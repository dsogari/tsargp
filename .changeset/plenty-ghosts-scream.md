Added a `breaks` property to help sections, to specify the number of line breaks to insert before a section. Added the `required` and `comment` properties to the usage section, to specify options that should be considered required in the usage, as well as to append a commentary to the usage, respectively. The demo was updated to include multiple usage sections.
