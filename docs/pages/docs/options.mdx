# Options

Any command-line interface is composed of commands and options (sometimes called _flags_). Options
allow the calling application or user to configure the command that will run. **tsargp** offers a
selection of option types that should suit most applications. In the next sections, we present the
available types and describe them in detail.

## Option types

Here's a summary of the available types and some of their attributes:

| Option type                  | Parameters                              | Data type       | Normalization      | Constraints         |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------ | ------------------- |
| [help](#help-option)         | niladic                                 |                 |                    |                     |
| [version](#version-option)   | niladic                                 |                 |                    |                     |
| [function](#function-option) | niladic                                 |                 |                    |                     |
| [flag](#flag-option)         | niladic                                 | `boolean{:ts}`  |                    |                     |
| [boolean](#boolean-option)   | positional, monadic                     | `boolean{:ts}`  |                    |                     |
| [string](#string-option)     | positional, monadic                     | `string{:ts}`   | trim, case         | enums, regex        |
| [number](#number-option)     | positional, monadic                     | `number{:ts}`   | round              | enums, range        |
| [strings](#strings-option)   | positional, variadic, delimited, append | `string[]{:ts}` | unique, trim, case | enums, regex, limit |
| [numbers](#numbers-option)   | positional, variadic, delimited, append | `number[]{:ts}` | unique, round      | enums, range, limit |

In the above table, _niladic_ means that the option expects no parameter on the command-line;
_monadic_, that the option accepts a single parameter; and _variadic_, multiple parameters (possibly
zero). The data type indicates the base type of the option value in the
[result object](parser.mdx#option-values). The meaning of the other attributes is explained in the
next sections.

## Common attributes

This section describes attributes that are common to a subset of option types. The option types
themselves are explained later in this page.

### Basic attributes

All option types share a set of attributes in addition to their type. From these, only the
[names](#names--preferred-name) attribute is required, while the rest is optional. They are
described below.

#### Names & preferred name

The `names` attribute lists the option names as they may appear on the command-line (e.g. `-h` or
`--help`). Names must not contain whitespace or the equals sign `'='{:ts}` (since it may be used as
option-value separator). Empty strings or `null{:ts}`s can be specified in order to skip the
respective "slot" in the help message [names column](formatter.mdx#names-column), although there
must be at least one _non-empty_ name.

The `preferredName` attribute, if present, is displayed in error and help messages in cases where a
name is not available (e.g., when evaluating option requirements or processing positional arguments).
It is not validated, so it can be any string. If not specified, the first name in the `names` array
will be used.

#### Synopsis & deprecated

The `desc` attribute is the option synopsis. The `deprecated` attribute is just syntactic
sugar for the option deprecation reason. Both attributes are formatted in the help message according
to [text formatting](formatter.mdx#text-formatting) rules.

> **NOTE**:
> Since the library was designed to avoid using the console directly, it doesn't have a proper way
> to handle deprecated options specified on the command-line (e.g., by logging a warning). For this
> purpose, you may want to use a custom parsing callback (more on that later), although it is only
> available for non-niladic options.

#### Group & hide

The `group` attribute is the name of a group under which the option should appear in the help
message, whereas the `hide` attribute indicates to the formatter that the option should _not_ be
displayed in the help message.

#### Display styles

The `styles` attribute can be used to customize the styling of the help message entry for the
option. It has the following optional properties:

- `names` - the style of the option names
- `param` - the style of the option paramater
- `descr` - the style of the option description

#### Requirements

The `requires` attribute, if present, specifies the option requirements, which can be either:

- an option key;
- an object that maps option keys to required values; or
- a requirement expression

If set, then these requirements will be verified whenever the option is specified on the
command-line. If it is an option key, then the referenced option must also be present on the
command-line. If an object, then every referenced option should be present and have the
corresponding value. If an expression, then it is evaluated as follows:

- `req.all` - an expression that is satisfied only when _all_ items are satisfied
- `req.one` - an expression that is satisfied when _at least one_ item is satisfied
- `req.not` - an expression that is satisfied when the item is _not_ satisfied.

> **NOTE**:
> When an object is specified, `undefined{:ts}` values can be used to signify required presence, and
> `null{:ts}` values to signify required absence.

#### External reference

The `link` attribute is the URL of an external resource or media, that is included in the help
message if specified.

### Parameter attributes

All non-niladic option types share a set of attributes, which are described below.

#### Required

The `required` attribute indicates that the option is _always_ required, independently of other
options. Mutually exclusive with [default value](#default-value--callback).

#### Default value | callback

The `default` attribute, if present, specifies the option's default value or a callback that returns
the default value. This value is set as the option's value at the end of the parsing loop _if_ the
option was not specified on the command-line. Mutually exclusive with [required](#required).

If the value is not known beforehand (e.g., if it depends on the values of other options), you may
want to use a callback to inspect parsed values and determine the default value based on those
values. This callback accepts one parameter:

- `values` - the parsed values. It is a generic record that should be cast to
  `OptionValues<typeof _your_options_>{:ts}` or to the type of your values class.

#### Example value

The `example` attribute, if present, specifies a value that replaces the option type in the help
message [parameter column](formatter.mdx#parameter-column). Mutually exclusive with
[parameter name](#parameter-name).

#### Parameter name

The `paramName` attribute, if present, replaces the option type in the help message
[parameter column](formatter.mdx#parameter-column). Mutually exclusive with
[example value](#example-value).

> **NOTE**:
> If it contains an opening angle bracket `'<'{:ts}`, it is printed as-is; otherwise it is enclosed
> in angle brackets (e.g., `<param_name>`).

#### Positional | marker

The `positional` attribute, if present, indicates that the option accepts positional arguments.
There may be _at most one_ option with this setting.

If set to `true{:ts}`, then any argument not recognized as an option name will be considered
positional. Additionally, this attribute accepts a string which acts as positional marker. In this
case, all arguments that appear _beyond the marker_ will be considered positional.

When using this attribute, we recommend also setting [preferred name](#names--preferred-name) to
some explanatory name.

#### Complete callback

The `complete` attribute, if present, specifies a custom completion callback. This can be used to
make better suggestions for bash completion than the
[default algorithm](parser.mdx#completion-algorithm) would do for the option. It accepts two
parameters:

- `values` - the values parsed up until the current iteration. It is a generic record that should be
  cast to `OptionValues<typeof _your_options_>{:ts}` or to the type of your values class.
- `comp` - the word being completed (it may be an empty string)
- `rest` - the remaining command-line arguments

It should return the list of completion words and should not throw any errors. If asynchronous, you
should call [`parseAsync`](parser.mdx#asynchronous-parsing) and await its result.

#### Parse callback

The `parse` attribute, if present, specifies a custom callback to parse the value of the option
parameter. It accepts two parameters:

- `name` - the option name, as was specified on the command-line
- `value` - the parameter string value

It should return a value of the data type expected by the option (this should be a single value, not
an array). If asynchronous, then the data type of the option value in the resulting object will be
enclosed in a promise. Mutually exclusive with [separator](#separator) and
[parse delimited](#parse-delimited).

#### Enumeration

The `enums` attribute, if present, specifies enumerated values that the option accepts as parameter.
Any parameter that does not equal one of these values (after normalization) will cause an error to
be thrown. Explicitly not available for the [boolean option](#boolean-option). Mutually exclusive
with [regular expression](#regular-expression) and [numeric range](#numeric-range).

### String attributes

String-valued option types share a set of attributes, as described below.

#### Regular expression

The `regex` attribute, if present, specifies a regular expression that string parameters should
match. Any parameter that does _not match_ the regular expression (after normalization) will cause
an error to be thrown. Mutually exclusive with [enumeration](#enumeration).

#### Trim whitespace

The `trim` attribute, if present, indicates that string parameters will be trimmed (i.e., have
leading and trailing whitespace removed). This normalization is applied _before_ checking value
constraints.

#### Case conversion

The `case` attribute, if present, specifies the kind of case conversion to apply to string
parameters. Can be one of `'lower'{:ts}` (convert to lowercase) or `'upper'{:ts}` (convert to
uppercase). This normalization is applied _before_ checking value constraints.

### Number attributes

Number-valued option types share a set of attributes, as described below.

#### Numeric range

The `range` attribute, if present, specifies a (closed) numeric range that number parameters should
be within. Any parameter that is _not within_ the given range (after normalization) will cause an
error to be thrown. You may want to use `[-Infinity, Infinity]{:ts}` to disallow `NaN{:ts}`.
Mutually exclusive with [enumeration](#enumeration).

#### Rounding

The `round` attribute, if present, specifies the kind of rounding to apply to number parameters. Can
be one of `'trunc'{:ts}` (truncate), `'floor'{:ts}` (round down), `'ceil'{:ts}` (round up) or
`'near'{:ts}` (round to nearest integer). This normalization is applied _before_ checking value
constraints.

### Array attributes

Array-valued option types share a set of attributes, as described below.

#### Separator

The `separator` attribute, if present, specifies a delimiter by which to split parameter values. If
specified, the option will accept a single parameter and not multiple parameters (we say that it is
_delimited_, rather than being _variadic_). Can be a string or a regular expression. Mutually
exclusive with [parse callback](#parse-callback) and [parse delimited](#parse-delimited).

#### Parse delimited

The `parseDelimited` attribute, if present, specifies a custom callback to parse the value of the
option parameter. It accepts two parameters:

- `name` - the option name, as was specified on the command-line
- `value` - the parameter string value

Unlike the [parse callback](#parse-callback) that returns a single value, this callback should
return an array. If specified, the option will accept a single parameter and not multiple parameters
(we say that it is _delimited_, rather than being _variadic_). If asynchronous, then the data type
of the option value in the resulting object will be enclosed in a promise. Mutually exclusive with
[separator](#separator) and [parse callback](#parse-callback).

#### Remove duplicates

The `unique` attribute, if present, indicates that duplicate elements will be removed from the
option value. This normalization is applied _before_ checking the [count limit](#count-limit)
constraint.

#### Append values

The `append` attribute, if present, indicates that the option allows appending elements to its
value if specified multiple times on the command-line. Both the [unique](#unique) normalization and
the [count limit](#count-limit) constraint (if enabled) are applied after appendage.

#### Count limit

The `limit` attribute, if present, indicates the maximum allowed number of array elements. Any
parameter that causes the option value to _exceed_ the given limit (after normalization) will cause
an error to be thrown.

## Niladic options

These option types expect no parameter on the command-line. With the notable exception of the
[flag option](#flag-option), they have no intrinsic value and therefore do not appear in the object
resulting from argument parsing. However, they do have side-effects, as explained next.

### Help option

The **help** option is a convenient specialization of the [function option](#function-option) option
that handles the formatting of the help message. Internally, it performs the following actions:

1. instantiate a [formatter](formatter.mdx) class with the provided (or default) configuration
2. get the formatted messages, one for each option group
3. assemble them into a single message interspersed with group headings
4. throw the resulting string

The application should catch the string and print it on a terminal. This string contains control
sequences that can only be interpreted by a terminal, so it should not, for instance, be written to
a file.

This option has the following set of optional attributes.

#### Usage & footer

The `usage` attribute describes your CLI usage instructions. It goes before everything else in the
help message. The `footer` attribute is an afterword that can be used to insert a copyright notice
or reference to other media. Both attributes can include inline styles, but they will _not_ be
formatted according to the [text formatting](formatter.mdx#text-formatting) rules.

#### Format & heading style

The `format` attribute, if present, specifies the [help format](formatter.mdx#help-format)
configuration. The `headingStyle` attribute, if present, specifies a [style](styles.mdx) to be
applied to group headings.

### Version option

The **version** option is another specialization of the [function](#function-option) option that
throws a version message. You may specify either of the following attributes.

#### Semantic version

The `version` attribute is a semantic version or version information. Mutually exclusive with
[resolve callback](#resolve-callback).

#### Resolve callback

The `resolve` attribute is a resolution function scoped to the module where a `package.json` file
will be searched and read to extract its `version` field. For use in non-browser environments only.
You should use [`import.meta.resolve`] as value. This results in an asynchronous operation, so you
should call [`parseAsync`](parser.mdx#asynchronous-parsing) and await its result. Mutually exclusive
with [semantic version](#semantic-version).

[`import.meta.resolve`]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/import.meta/resolve

### Function option

The **function** option executes a generic callback function. The following attributes can be
specified.

#### Execute callback

The `exec` attribute is the callback function that should be executed. It accepts three parameters:

- `values` - the values parsed up until the current iteration. It is a generic record that should be
  cast to `OptionValues<typeof _your_options_>{:ts}` or to the type of your values class.
- `comp` - `true{:ts}` if performing completion (but not in the current iteration)
- `rest` - the remaining command-line arguments

It should return nothing. It can be asynchronous, in which case you should call
[`parseAsync`](parser.mdx#asynchronous-parsing) and await its result.

#### Break

The `break` attribute, if present, tells the parser to exit the parsing loop immediately after
returning from the callback. This is useful for creating commands, as explained in the
[commands guide](/guides/commands).

> BEWARE: If set, the requirements of all options specified before it on the command-line (including
> itself) will be analyzed. Hence, you should make it clear in the help message that any required
> option should be specified before it.

### Flag option

The **flag** option is special in the sense that it is both niladic and has a value (boolean). The
way it differs from the [boolean option](#boolean-option) is that it does not expect a parameter,
although it may have the [required](#required) or the [default value](#default-value--callback)
attribute for a `boolean{:ts}` data type. In addition, it has the following attribute.

> **NOTE**:
> We could have reused the boolean option for this purpose and make the parameter optional, but it
> would complicate the parser implementation unnecessarily. Besides, the flag option has a
> particularly useful feature, which is described below.

#### Negation names

The `negationNames` attribute specifies alternate option names that can be used to turn the option
value `false{:ts}` (e.g., _--no-flag_). This is useful in scripting scenarios where a flag that has
been previously specified must be reset by a supplementary list of arguments.

## Non-niladic options

### Boolean option

The **boolean** option has the same set of [parameter attributes](#parameter-attributes) for a
`boolean{:ts}` data type.

### String option

The **string** option has the set of [parameter attributes](#parameter-attributes) for a
`string{:ts}` data type, as well as the set of [string attributes](#string-attributes).

### Number option

The **number** option has the set of [parameter attributes](#parameter-attributes) for a
`number{:ts}` data type, as well as the set of [number attributes](#number-attributes).

### Strings option

The **strings** option has the set of [parameter attributes](#parameter-attributes) for a
`string[]{:ts}` data type, as well as the sets of [string attributes](#string-attributes) and
[array attributes](#array-attributes).

### Numbers option

The **numbers** option has the set of [parameter attributes](#parameter-attributes) for a
`number[]{:ts}` data type, as well as the sets of [number attributes](#number-attributes) and
[array attributes](#array-attributes).
