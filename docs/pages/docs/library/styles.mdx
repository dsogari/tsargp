# Styles

The `Style` type is a string literal consisting of a Select Graphic Rendition ([SGR]) sequence. It
can be used to customize the display of text in a terminal.

## Styling attributes

The `style` function accepts a list of styling attributes and creates a `Style` that can be used in
any part of the API that expects this type, or it can be embedded directly in text attributes, such
as the [synopsis and deprecation reason](options.mdx#synopsis--deprecated), the
[usage and footer](options.mdx#usage--footer), or the [error phrases](validator.mdx#error-phrases)
and [help phrases](formatter.mdx#help-phrases).

In the next sections we present the various styling attributes available.

<Callout type="warning">
  Not all of the attributes are supported in every terminal, so you should experiment with them
  before committing your code.
</Callout>

### Type faces

The `tf` enumeration declares text type faces that can be combined together. Here is the full list:

- `clear` - reset or normal (resets any other preceding SGR attribute)
- `bold` - bold or increased intensity
- `faint` - faint, decreased intensity, or dim
- `italic` - italic
- `underlined` - underlined
- `slowlyBlinking` - slowly blinking
- `rapidlyBlinking` - rapidly blinking
- `inverse` - reverse video or inverse (flips foreground and background color)
- `invisible` - invisible, concealed or hidden
- `crossedOut` - crossed-out or strikethrough
- `primary` - primary (default) font
- `alternative1` - alternative font 1
- `alternative2` - alternative font 2
- `alternative3` - alternative font 3
- `alternative4` - alternative font 4
- `alternative5` - alternative font 5
- `alternative6` - alternative font 6
- `alternative7` - alternative font 7
- `alternative8` - alternative font 8
- `alternative9` - alternative font 9
- `gothic` - black-letter font (Fraktur/Gothic)
- `doublyUnderlined` - doubly underlined
- `notBoldOrFaint` - normal intensity (neither bold nor faint)
- `notItalic` - regular face (neither italic nor black-letter)
- `notUnderlined` - not underlined
- `notBlinking` - steady (not blinking)
- `proportionalSpacing` - proportional spacing
- `notInverse` - positive (not inverse)
- `notInvisible` - visible (reveal, or not hidden)
- `notCrossedOut` - not crossed out (no strikethrough)
- `notProportionalSpacing` - disable proportional spacing
- `framed` - framed
- `encircled` - encircled
- `overlined` - overlined
- `notFramedOrEncircled` - neither framed nor encircled
- `notOverlined` - not overlined
- `ideogramUnderline` - ideogram underline or right side line
- `ideogramDoubleUnderline` - ideogram double underline, or double line on the right side
- `ideogramOverline` - ideogram overline or left side line
- `ideogramDoubleOverline` - ideogram double overline, or double line on the left side
- `ideogramStressMarking` - ideogram stress marking
- `noIdeogram` - no ideogram attributes
- `superscript` - superscript
- `subscript` - subscript.
- `notSuperscriptOrSubscript` - neither superscript nor subscript.

### Predefined text colors

The `fg` and `bg` enumerations declare predefined foreground and background colors, respectively:

- `default` - the default color
- standard colors:
  - `black` - black
  - `red` - red
  - `green` - green
  - `yellow` - yellow
  - `blue` - blue
  - `magenta` - magenta
  - `cyan` - cyan
  - `white` - white
- high-intensity colors:
  - `brightBlack` - bright black (gray)
  - `brightRed` - bright red
  - `brightGreen` - bright green
  - `brightYellow` - bright yellow
  - `brightBlue` - bright blue
  - `brightMagenta` - bright magenta
  - `brightCyan` - bright cyan
  - `brightWhite` - bright white

The `ul` enumeration has a single value of `default` for the default underline color.

### Extended text colors

In addition to predefined colors, there are three utility functions to get custom 8-bit colors:

- `fg8` - creates a foreground color from an 8-bit decimal value
- `bg8` - creates a background color from an 8-bit decimal value
- `ul8` - creates an underline color from an 8-bit decimal value

## Terminal strings

The `TerminalString` class is an internal component that handles the construction of strings that
can be printed in a terminal. It has methods to append strings with or without control sequences,
and is used both by the [parser](parser.mdx) (to create error messages) and by the
[formatter](formatter.mdx) (to build help messages).

The main logic implemented in this class is divided into _splitting_ and _wrapping_, as is explained
below.

### Text splitting

Text is split on paragraph, list item and word boundaries using a combination of simple regular
expressions that do _not_ take quotes into account. The following features are supported in text
splitting.

#### Format specifiers

Format specifiers can be extracted from the text and processed by a formatting callback. This is
used in two places in the library:

- by the parser to produce error messages based on configured
  [error phrases](validator.mdx#error-phrases)
- by the formatter to assemble help items from configured [help phrases](formatter.mdx#help-phrases)

This particular feature is only available in _phrases_, not in text attributes of option definitions.

#### Inline styles

Text can contain inline styles. This applies to phrases as well as text attributes, such as the
option synopsis or the deprecation reason, which the formatter splits into words before adding to
the option description.

The terminal string instance will try its best to preserve styles while splitting text. However,
if some corner case that is not currently covered by the unit tests happen to you, please submit a
[bug report].

#### Paragraphs and lists

Although markdown syntax is not currently supported, paragraphs and itemized/numbered lists are
formatted similarly to how they would be in markdown. For example, the following text

```ansi
A paragraph with
  single line breaks,  redundant  spacing  and:
    - itemized; or
  1. numbered lists

  Another paragraph
```

Would be rendered as:

```ansi
A paragraph with single line breaks, redundant spacing and:
- itemized; or
1. numbered lists

Another paragraph
```

### Text wrapping

Text is wrapped according to a configured _width_: the number of terminal columns by which to limit
each line of text. When a width of zero (or `undefined{:ts}`) is provided, the terminal string
instance will suppress inline styles and omit control sequences that it would otherwise use for
rendering text in a terminal.

#### Indentation level

A terminal string optionally has a starting column: the indentation level respective to the first
terminal column. When wrapping text to a desired width, it tries to respect this setting, but if
the desired width does not accommodate the text while respecting its indentation level, the text is
instead wrapped relative to the beginning of each line.

#### Error messages

The `ErrorMessage` class is a wrapper of a terminal string. It provides a `wrap` method to get a
normal string, which accepts an optional parameter:

- `width` - the terminal width (defaults to `process.stderr.columns`)

Its default value is the number of columns of the standard _error_ stream.

<Callout type="info">
  When redirecting the output of a command to a file, the associated stream will not have the 
  `columns` property. Hence, if `stderr` is being redirected, the default value of the above
  parameter will be `undefined{:ts}`.
</Callout>

#### Help messages

The `HelpMessage` class is analog to the above one, except that the default value of the `width`
parameter is the number of columns of the standard _output_ stream (`process.stdout.columns`).

<Callout type="default">
  Error and help messages are thrown by the library as instances of either one of the above classes.
  So you can check if a captured error is an instance of either one through `instanceof{:ts}`.
</Callout>
