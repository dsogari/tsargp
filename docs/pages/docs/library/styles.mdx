# Styles

The `Style` type is a string literal consisting of a Select Graphic Rendition ([SGR]) sequence. It
can be used to customize the display of text in a terminal.

## Styling attributes

With the `style` function you can create a style from a list of styling attributes. The result can
be used in any part of the API that expects the `Style` type, or it can be embedded directly in text
attributes, such as the [synopsis and deprecation reason](options.mdx#synopsis--deprecated) or the
[usage and footer](options.mdx#usage--footer).

In the next sections we present the various styling attributes available.

<Callout type="warning">
  Not all of the attributes are supported in every terminal, so you should experiment with them
  before committing your code.
</Callout>

### Type faces

The `tf` enumeration declares text type faces that can be combined together. Here is the full list:

- `clear` - reset or normal (resets any other preceding SGR attribute)
- `bold` - bold or increased intensity
- `faint` - faint, decreased intensity, or dim
- `italic` - italic
- `underlined` - underlined
- `slowlyBlinking` - slowly blinking
- `rapidlyBlinking` - rapidly blinking
- `inverse` - reverse video or inverse (flips foreground and background color)
- `invisible` - invisible, concealed or hidden
- `crossedOut` - crossed-out or strikethrough
- `primary` - primary (default) font
- `alternative1` - alternative font 1
- `alternative2` - alternative font 2
- `alternative3` - alternative font 3
- `alternative4` - alternative font 4
- `alternative5` - alternative font 5
- `alternative6` - alternative font 6
- `alternative7` - alternative font 7
- `alternative8` - alternative font 8
- `alternative9` - alternative font 9
- `gothic` - black-letter font (Fraktur/Gothic)
- `doublyUnderlined` - doubly underlined
- `notBoldOrFaint` - normal intensity (neither bold nor faint)
- `notItalic` - regular face (neither italic nor black-letter)
- `notUnderlined` - not underlined
- `notBlinking` - steady (not blinking)
- `proportionalSpacing` - proportional spacing
- `notInverse` - positive (not inverse)
- `notInvisible` - visible (reveal, or not hidden)
- `notCrossedOut` - not crossed out (no strikethrough)
- `notProportionalSpacing` - disable proportional spacing
- `framed` - framed
- `encircled` - encircled
- `overlined` - overlined
- `notFramedOrEncircled` - neither framed nor encircled
- `notOverlined` - not overlined
- `ideogramUnderline` - ideogram underline or right side line
- `ideogramDoubleUnderline` - ideogram double underline, or double line on the right side
- `ideogramOverline` - ideogram overline or left side line
- `ideogramDoubleOverline` - ideogram double overline, or double line on the left side
- `ideogramStressMarking` - ideogram stress marking
- `noIdeogram` - no ideogram attributes
- `superscript` - superscript
- `subscript` - subscript.
- `notSuperscriptOrSubscript` - neither superscript nor subscript.

### Predefined text colors

The `fg` and `bg` enumerations declare predefined foreground and background colors, respectively:

- `default` - the default color
- standard colors:
  - `black` - black
  - `red` - red
  - `green` - green
  - `yellow` - yellow
  - `blue` - blue
  - `magenta` - magenta
  - `cyan` - cyan
  - `white` - white
- high-intensity colors:
  - `brightBlack` - bright black (gray)
  - `brightRed` - bright red
  - `brightGreen` - bright green
  - `brightYellow` - bright yellow
  - `brightBlue` - bright blue
  - `brightMagenta` - bright magenta
  - `brightCyan` - bright cyan
  - `brightWhite` - bright white

The `ul` enumeration has a single value of `default` for the default underline color.

### Extended text colors

In addition to predefined colors, there are three utility functions to get custom 8-bit colors:

- `fg8` - creates a foreground color from an 8-bit decimal value
- `bg8` - creates a background color from an 8-bit decimal value
- `ul8` - creates an underline color from an 8-bit decimal value

## Terminal strings

The `TerminalString` class is an internal component that handles the construction of strings that
can be printed in a terminal. It has methods to append strings with or without control sequences,
and is used both by the [parser](parser.mdx) (to create error messages) and by the
[formatter](formatter.mdx) (to build help messages).

The main logic implemented in this class is divided into _splitting_ and _wrapping_, as is explained
below.

### Text splitting

Text is split on paragraph, list item and word boundaries using a combination of simple regular
expressions. Moreover, format specifiers can be extracted from the text and processed by a
formatting callback. This is used in two places in the library:

- by the argument parser to create error messages based on configured
  [error phrases](validator.mdx#error-phrases)
- by the help message formatter to assemble help items from configured
  [help phrases](formatter.mdx#help-phrases)

In addition to error and help phrases, some help items such as the option synopsis or the
deprecation reason are texts that the help formatter splits into words before adding to the option
description. The formatting features supported for these items are described next.

#### Inline styles

Text can contain inline styles. The terminal string instance will try its best to preserve styles
while splitting or wrapping text. However, if some corner case that is not currently covered by the
unit tests happen to you, please submit a [bug report].

#### Paragraphs and lists

Although markdown syntax is not currently supported, paragraphs and itemized/numbered lists are
formatted similarly to how they would be in markdown. For example, the following text

```ansi
A paragraph with
  single line breaks,  redundant  spacing  and:
    - itemized; or
  1. numbered lists

  Another paragraph
```

Would be rendered as:

```ansi
A paragraph with single line breaks, redundant spacing and:
- itemized; or
1. numbered lists

Another paragraph
```

### Text wrapping

Text is wrapped according to a configured width, which is the number of terminal columns by which to
limit each line of text. When a zero or undefined width is provided, the terminal string instance
will suppress inline styles and omit control sequences that it would otherwise use for rendering
text in a terminal.

#### Error messages

The `ErrorMessage` class is a wrapper of a terminal string. It provides a `wrap` method to get a
normal string, which accepts an optional parameter:

- `width` - the terminal width (in number of columns)

Its default value is the number of columns of the standard _error_ stream
(`process.stderr.columns`).

<Callout type="info">
  When redirecting the output of a command to a file, the associated stream will not have the 
  `columns` property. Hence, if `stderr` is being redirected, the default value of the above
  parameter will be `undefined{:ts}`.
</Callout>

#### Help messages

The `HelpMessage` class is analog to the above one, except that the default value of the `width`
parameter is the number of columns of the standard _output_ stream (`process.stdout.columns`).

<Callout type="default">
  Error and help messages are thrown by the library as instances of either one of the above classes.
  So you can check if a captured error is an instance of either one through `instanceof{:ts}`.
</Callout>
