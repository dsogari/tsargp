# Formatter

The `HelpFormatter` is an interface for components that handle formatting of help messages. Concrete
classes that implement it can be instantiated with a set of option _definitions_ and provide methods
to format help messages.

## Help format

There are four concrete classes of formatter, each one handling a different help message format:

- `AnsiFormatter` -
  formats help messages in ANSI format, i.e., they may contain escape sequences and are meant to be
  printed in a terminal
- `JsonFormatter` -
  formats help messages in JSON format, i.e., they are meant to be consumed by introspection tools
  and other applications
- `CsvFormatter` -
  formats help messages in CSV format, i.e., they are meant to be transformed and exchanged with
  other applications
- `MdFormatter` -
  formats help messages in Markdown format, i.e., they are meant to be processed by documentation
  tools, or to be versioned with the code

<Callout type="warning">
  Everything contained in this page relates to the `AnsiFormatter` class.

## Help message

Internally, the help message is a list of [terminal strings] that may contain control sequences and
are meant to be printed in a terminal. Visually, it can be divided into the following pieces of
content:

- section - a group of text lines, like the section of a document
- entry - the lines corresponding to an option definition
- item - a single bit of information in an option's description
- group - a set of entries corresponding to an option [group]
- column - a horizontal division (as formed by a vertical ruler) across all entries of all groups

There are two main ways of obtaining help messages, as described below.

### Grouped help

The `format` method returns the help message of an option group. It accepts a single optional
parameter: the name of the group. If not provided, the _default_ group is used, which corresponds to
the set of options that did not explicitly declare a [group] in their definition.

### Sectioned help

The `sections` method returns a help message that includes [help sections], as will be explained
later in this page. It accepts two parameters:

- `sections` - a list of `HelpSection`s to include in the help message
- `progName` - an optional program name to display in usage sections

## Help entries

Each option definition results in a help entry being included under its respective group in the help
message. An entry is divided into "columns" (not to be confused with terminal columns), each
containing a piece of information, as described below.

### Names column

This column contains the options' names separated by commas. The names are listed in the same order
as was specified in the [names] attribute.

#### Name slots

Depending on the column's [alignment] configuration, each option name may reserve a "slot" in the
respective position in this column. The length of a name slot will be the length of the largest name
in that slot, among all options. Empty strings or `null{:ts}`s can be specified in order to skip a
slot.

For example, if an option's names are `'-f'{:ts}`, `'-ff'{:ts}`, `''{:ts}` and `'--flag'{:ts}`, the
resulting entry might be formatted as:

```
-f, -ff      --flag
```

Note how the empty string produced whitespace between its neighbors, and the commas were suppressed.

### Parameter column

This column contains either the option's `type`, the [example value] or the [parameter name]. It is
rendered in the following way:

- if the option:
  - is [niladic], it is omitted
  - contains an example value, this value is used
  - is a command option, it is rendered with a standalone ellipsis `'...'{:ts}`
  - is a function option, `type` is replaced by the word `param`
  - does not have a parameter name containing an opening angle bracket `'<'{:ts}`, it is enclosed in
    angle brackets `'<>'{:ts}`
  - requires [inline parameters], it is prefixed with an equals sign `'='{:ts}`
  - accepts more than one parameter, it is suffixed with an ellipsis `'...'{:ts}`
  - can be specified without parameters, it is enclosed in square brackets `'[]'{:ts}`

The result might be something like `=<param>` or `[<param>...]`.

### Description column

The last column contains the option description and is composed of [help items], which are explained
later in this page.

## Help sections

Sections are a convenient way to organize the help content. There are three kinds of help sections:
text, usage and groups. They are explained below.

### Common properties

All help sections share a set of properties:

- `title` - the section heading or the default option group heading (defaults to none)
- `style` - the style of the section heading or option group headings (defaults to `tf.bold{:ts}`)
- `breaks` - the number of line breaks to insert before the section (defaults to `0{:ts}` for the
  first section, else `2{:ts}`)
- `noWrap` - true to disable wrapping of provided texts (defaults to `false{:ts}`)

<Callout type="info">
  When `noWrap` is set, inline styles may still be used in text properties, but the latter will
  _not_ be formatted according to the [text formatting] rules.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
  All headings are separated from their content by _two_ line feeds, unless extra spacing is
  provided in heading texts. For the sake of simplicity, there is no way to configure this behavior.
</Callout>

### Text section

A text section can be used to write many kinds of content, such as an introductory text, CLI usage
instructions, afterword, copyright notice or external references. In addition to the [common
properties], it has the following properties:

- `text` - the section content
- `indent` - the level of indentation of the section content (defaults to `0{:ts}`)

### Usage section

The usage text is a concise representation of a program's command-line. Here is an example:

{/* cSpell:disable */}

```ansi
demo.js [([95m-h[0m|[95m--help[0m)] [([95m-v[0m|[95m--version[0m)] [32m# get help[0m
demo.js [0m[95mhello[0m [90m...[0m [32m# execute the hello command[0m
demo.js [([95m-f[0m|[95m--flag[0m|[95m--no-flag[0m)]
        [([95m-b[0m|[95m--boolean[0m) [90m<boolean>[0m]
        [([95m-s[0m|[95m--stringRegex[0m) [90m<my str>[0m]
        [([95m-n[0m|[95m--numberRange[0m) [90m<my num>[0m]
        [([95m-se[0m|[95m--stringEnum[0m) [32m'one'[0m]
        [([95m-ne[0m|[95m--numberEnum[0m) [33m1[0m]
        [([95m-ss[0m|[95m--strings[0m) [90m[<strings>][0m]
        [([95m-ns[0m|[95m--numbers[0m) [90m<numbers>...[0m]
        [[([95m--stringsEnum[0m|[95m--[0m)] [32m'one'[0m [32m'two'[0m]
        [[95m--numbersEnum[0m [32m'1,2'[0m]
```

{/* cSpell:enable */}

In addition to the [common properties], a usage section has the following properties:

- `indent` - the level of indentation of the section content (defaults to `0{:ts}`)
- `filter` - a list of option keys to include or exclude (defaults to including all options)
- `exclude` - whether the filter should exclude (defaults to `false{:ts}`)
- `required` - a list of options that should be considered always required
- `requires` - a map of option keys to required options (defaults to none)
- `comment` - a commentary to append to the usage (defaults to none)

<Callout type="default">
  The filter can be used to create multiple usages of the same command, with different options. In
  the case of an inclusion filter, options are listed in the same order specified in the filter.
</Callout>

#### Option dependencies

The `requires` property is equivalent to an adjacency list, except that each source option can only
reference a single target. Mutually dependent options are supported. The following table lists some
examples that illustrate how this works. Suppose we have options A, B and C. Then:

| Dependencies                       | Usage         | If C is always required |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------- | ----------------------- |
| A requires B requires C            | `[[[A] B] C]` | `[[A] B] C`             |
| A and B require each other         | `[A B] [C]`   | `[A B] C`               |
| A requires B requires C requires A | `[A B C]`     | `A B C`                 |
| A and C require B                  | `[[A] B [C]]` | `[A] B C`               |
| A requires B; C requires A         | `[[A [C]] B]` | `A C B`                 |

<Callout type="info">
  Mutual exclusivity and multi-targeting are _not_ supported. For that purpose, you have to create
  different usages. (The reason is that this is difficult to implement. We sincerely apologize.)
</Callout>

### Groups section

A groups section is a collection of option groups and their help entries. In addition to the [common
properties], it has the following properties:

- `filter` - a list of group names to include or exclude (defaults to including all groups)
- `exclude` - whether the filter should exclude (defaults to `false{:ts}`)

<Callout type="default">
  In the case of an inclusion filter, groups are listed in the same order specified in the filter.
</Callout>

## Formatter configuration

The formatter can be configured via a `PartialFormatterConfig` object, which can be provided as an
additional parameter to the formatter constructor. It contains the same properties as the [message
configuration], as well as the properties described below.

### Help columns

The `names`, `param` and `descr` properties specify settings that can be used to customize the
format of all help entries, for each [help column]. They are objects with the following optional
properties:

- `align` - text alignment for the column (may be one of `'left'{:ts}` or `'right'{:ts}`, defaults
  to `'left'{:ts}`)
- `indent` - level of indentation for the column (non-negative if `absolute` is `true{:ts}`,
  defaults to `2{:ts}`)
- `breaks` - number of line breaks to insert before each entry in the column (defaults to `0{:ts}`)
- `hidden` - whether the column should be hidden (defaults to `false{:ts}`)
- `absolute` - whether the indentation level should be relative to the beginning of the line instead
  of the end of the previous column (not available for the names column, defaults to `false{:ts}`)

The `names.align` property supports an additional value `'slot'{:ts}`, which means that each name
receives a "slot" in the column, and the name is left-aligned within that slot. See [name slots]
for more information.

The `param.align` and `descr.align` properties support an additional value `'merge'{:ts}`, which
instructs the formatter to merge the contents of the column with the previous one. This is useful,
for instance, if you want option parameters to be inlined with option names. When using this value,
the `indent` and `breaks` properties are ignored.

An example can better illustrate the effect of some of these settings. Suppose we have the following
configuration:

```ts
{
  names: {
    align: 'slot',  // assign a slot to each option name
  },
  param: {
    breaks: 1,      // break option parameters
    indent: -10,    // recede 10 terminal columns from the end of the names column
  },
  descr: {
    align: 'right', // align option descriptions to the right
    breaks: 1,      // break option descriptions
    indent: 20,     // indent 20 terminal columns...
    absolute: true, // from the beginning of the line
  }
}
```

The following is an extract of a help message produced with these settings:

{/* cSpell:disable */}

```ansi
  [95m-ne[0m,   [95m--numberEnum[0m
            [33m1[0m
                             [0mA number option. Values must be one of {[33m1[0m, [33m2[0m}.[0m
  [95m-ns[0m,   [95m--numbers[0m
            [90m[<param>...][0m
                      [0mA numbers option. Accepts multiple parameters. Values
                    must be in the range [[33m0[0m, [33mInfinity[0m]. Defaults to [[33m1[0m, [33m2[0m].[0m
```

{/* cSpell:enable */}

### Help phrases

The `phrases` property specifies the phrases to be used for each kind of help item. Its properties
are optional and are indexed by the `HelpItem` enumeration, which lists the kinds of help items.
They are summarized in the table below:

| Help item    | Description                                                                  | Default phrase                                                                   | Format specifiers              |

| `unique`     | Whether duplicate elements will be removed from an array-valued option value | `'Duplicate values will be removed.'{:ts}`                                       |                                |
| `limit`      | The element count limit of an array-valued option                            | `'Element count is limited to #0.'{:ts}`                                         | `#0` = the count limit         |

### Help items

The `items` property specifies the kinds of help items that should be displayed in option
descriptions, and in which order. It is an array whose values can be one of the enumerators from
`HelpItem`. The default is to print all items in the order listed in the [help phrases] table.

<Callout type="info">Help items are only rendered in help messages in ANSI format.</Callout>

<Callout type="default">
  You might want to use this to limit the amount of information, especially if you intend to export
  the help message in either CSV or Markdown format. In these formats, a table column is rendered
  for each help item, regardless of whether it has information or not.
</Callout>

### Option filter

The `filter` property specifies a list of patterns to select the options that will be rendered in
the help message. The filter matches options' names, synopsis and environment variable names. If
multiple patterns are provided, any matched one will suffice to include an option in the message.

<Callout type="default">
  This is inherently different from what a text search utility like `grep` would produce. The
  formatter will render the _whole_ help entry of options matching the given patterns, not just the
  matching lines.
</Callout>
