# Options

Any command-line interface is composed of commands and options (sometimes called _flags_). Options
allow the calling application or user to configure the command that will run. **tsargp** offers a
selection of option types that should suit most applications. In the next sections, we present the
available types and describe them in detail.

## Option types

There is a total of ten option types, as summarized in the table below:

| Option type                  | Parameters                              | Data type          | Normalization      | Constraints         |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------ | ------------------- |
| [help](#help-option)         | niladic                                 |                    |                    |                     |
| [version](#version-option)   | niladic                                 |                    |                    |                     |
| [function](#function-option) | niladic                                 | `unknown{:ts}`[^1] |                    |                     |
| [command](#command-option)   | niladic                                 | `unknown{:ts}`[^1] |                    |                     |
| [flag](#flag-option)         | niladic                                 | `boolean{:ts}`     |                    |                     |
| [boolean](#boolean-option)   | positional, monadic                     | `boolean{:ts}`     |                    |                     |
| [string](#string-option)     | positional, monadic                     | `string{:ts}`      | trim, case         | enums, regex        |
| [number](#number-option)     | positional, monadic                     | `number{:ts}`      | round              | enums, range        |
| [strings](#strings-option)   | positional, variadic, delimited, append | `string[]{:ts}`    | unique, trim, case | enums, regex, limit |
| [numbers](#numbers-option)   | positional, variadic, delimited, append | `number[]{:ts}`    | unique, round      | enums, range, limit |

[^1]: the return type of the function or command callback.

In the above table, _niladic_ means that the option expects zero parameters on the command-line;
_monadic_, that the option accepts a single parameter; and _variadic_, multiple parameters (possibly
zero). The data type indicates the base type of the option value in the
[resulting object](parser.mdx#option-values). The meaning of the other attributes is explained in
the next sections.

## Common attributes

This section describes attributes that are common to a subset of option types. The options
themselves will be explained later in this page.

### Basic attributes

All options share a set of attributes in addition to their type, which are described below.

<Callout type="default">None of these attributes is required, except for the `type`.</Callout>

#### Names & preferred name

The `names` attribute lists the option names as they may appear on the command-line (e.g. `-h` or
`--help`). Names must not contain whitespace or the equals sign `'='{:ts}`, since this character may
be used as option-value separator.

Empty strings or `null{:ts}`s can be specified in order to skip the respective "slot" in the help
message [names column](formatter.mdx#names-column). However, if the option is not positional (i.e.,
it does not accept positional arguments), then it must contain at least one valid name.

The `preferredName` attribute, if present, is displayed in error and help messages in cases where a
name is not available (e.g., when evaluating option requirements or processing positional arguments).
It is not validated, so it can be any string. If not specified, the first name in the `names` array
will be used.

#### Synopsis & deprecated

The `desc` attribute is the option synopsis. The `deprecated` attribute is just syntactic
sugar for the option deprecation reason. Both attributes are formatted in the help message according
to [text formatting](styles.mdx#text-splitting) rules.

<Callout type="info">
  Since the library was designed to avoid using the `console`, it does _not_ log warnings when it
  encounters deprecated options on the command-line. For this purpose, you may want to use a custom
  parsing callback (more on that later), although it is only available for non-niladic options.
</Callout>

#### Group & hide

The `group` attribute is the name of a group under which the option should appear in the help
message, whereas the `hide` attribute indicates to the formatter that the option should _not_ be
displayed in the help message.

<Callout type="default">
  You can assign a unique group to the [positional option](#positional--marker) (if there is one)
  and place it first in the option definitions, in order to highlight it in the help message.
</Callout>

#### Display styles

The `styles` attribute can be used to customize the styling of the help message entry for the
option. It has the following optional properties:

- `names` - the style of the option names
- `param` - the style of the option paramater
- `descr` - the style of the option description

#### External reference

The `link` attribute is the URL of an external resource or media, that is included in the help
message if specified.

### Value attributes

All option types that may have a value share a set of attributes, which are described below.

#### Always required

The `required` attribute indicates that the option is _always_ required, regardless of other
options. Mutually exclusive with [default value](#default-value--callback) and
[conditional requirements](#conditional-requirements).

#### Default value | callback

The `default` attribute, if present, specifies the default option value or a callback that returns
the default value. This value is set as the option's value at the end of the parsing loop _if_ the
option was specified neither on the command-line nor as an
[environment variable](#environment-variable). Mutually exclusive with
[always required](#always-required).

<Callout type="default">
  [Function options](#function-option) and [command options](#command-option) accept any kind of
  value as the default. In the case of object types, it's useful to specify a custom `toString`
  method to render it in the help message, e.g.:
  ```ts
  toString() {
    return JSON.stringify(this);
  }
  ```
</Callout>

If the value is not known beforehand (e.g., if it depends on the values of other options), you may
want to use a callback to inspect parsed values and determine the default value based on those
values. It accepts one parameter:

- `values` - the parsed values

Notes about this callback:

- if asynchronous, and is called, then the resulting option value will be a promise
- it may be configured with a custom `toString` method to render it in the help message

#### Forward requirements

The `requires` attribute, if present, specifies requirements that must be satisfied _if_ the option
is specified on the command-line. It can be either:

- an option key;
- an object that maps option keys to required values;
- a requirement expression; or
- a requirement callback

In the case of an option key, the referenced option must also be present on the command-line.
In the case of an object, every referenced option must have the corresponding value.
In the case of an expression, it is evaluated as follows:

- `req.all` - an expression that is satisfied only when _all_ items are satisfied
- `req.one` - an expression that is satisfied when _at least one_ item is satisfied
- `req.not` - an expression that is satisfied when the item is _not_ satisfied.

<Callout type="default">
  When an object is specified, `undefined{:ts}` values can be used to signify required _presence_,
  and `null{:ts}` values to signify required _absence_.
</Callout>

You can also specify a callback, which accepts the following parameter:

- `values` - the parsed values

Notes about this callback:

- it should return `true{:ts}` if the requirements were satisfied, or `false{:ts}` otherwise
- it cannot be asynchronous, since it must be evaluated within the parsing loop
- it may be configured with a custom `toString` method to render it in error and help messages

#### Conditional requirements

The `requiredIf` attribute, if present, specifies conditional requirements. They behave like the
reverse of the previous attribute: they indicate requirements that must be satisfied for the
affected option to be _considered_ required. Mutually exclusive with
[always required](#always-required).

An example might help elucidate this distinction. Suppose we have these requirements:

```ts
req.all(
  'option1',
  req.one({ option2: null }, req.not({ option3: [2] })),
  (values) => values['option1'] === values['option3'],
);
```

If they were defined in the `requires` attribute, they would mean:

> _If this option is specified (either on the command-line or in an environment variable), then the
> following must hold true: `option1` must be present AND (`option2` must be absent OR `option3`
> must have a value different than `[2]`) AND `option1` must have the same value as `option3`._

If they were defined in the `requiredIf` attribute, they would mean:

> _If `option1` is present AND (`option2` is absent OR `option3` has a value different than `[2]`)
> AND `option1` has the same value as `option3`, then this option is considered required and must be
> specified (either on the command-line or in an environment variable)._

<Callout type="info">
  During requirement evaluation, values are compared _after_ being normalized.
</Callout>

#### Environment variable

The `envVar` attribute, if present, specifies the name of an environment variable from which the
option value will be read, in case the option is not specified on the command-line. Explicitly _not_
available for [function options](#function-option) and [command options](#command-option).

<Callout type="info">
  If the environemnt variable for an option is found, the option is counted as if it were specified
  on the command-line, which has implications for the evaluation of other option's requirements.
</Callout>

### Parameter attributes

All non-niladic option types share a set of attributes, which are described below.

#### Example value

The `example` attribute, if present, specifies a value that replaces the option type in the help
message [parameter column](formatter.mdx#parameter-column). Mutually exclusive with
[parameter name](#parameter-name).

#### Parameter name

The `paramName` attribute, if present, replaces the option type in the help message
[parameter column](formatter.mdx#parameter-column). If it contains an opening angle bracket
`'<'{:ts}`, it is printed as-is; otherwise it is enclosed in angle brackets (e.g., `<param_name>`).
Mutually exclusive with [example value](#example-value).

#### Positional | marker

The `positional` attribute, if present, indicates that the option accepts _positional_ arguments.
There may be at most _one_ option with this setting.

If set to `true{:ts}`, then any argument not recognized as an option name will be considered
positional. If set to a string, then this string acts as positional marker. In this case, all
arguments that appear _beyond_ the marker will be considered positional.

When using this attribute, we recommend also setting [preferred name](#names--preferred-name) to
some explanatory name.

#### Complete callback

The `complete` attribute, if present, specifies a custom completion callback. This can be used to
make better suggestions for bash completion than the
[default algorithm](parser.mdx#completion-algorithm) would do for the option. It accepts three
parameters:

- `values` - the values parsed up to the current iteration
- `comp` - the word being completed (it may be an empty string)
- `rest` - the remaining command-line arguments

Notes about this callback:

- it should return the list of completion words and should not throw any errors
- if asynchronous, you should await the result of [`parseAsync`](parser.mdx#executing-callbacks)

#### Parse callback

The `parse` attribute, if present, specifies a custom callback to parse the value of the option
parameter. It accepts three parameters:

- `values` - the values parsed up to the current iteration
- `name` - the option name, as was specified on the command-line
- `value` - the parameter string value

Notes about this callback:

- it should return a value of the data type expected by the option (this should not be an array)
- if asynchronous, and is called, then the resulting option value will be a promise
- mutually exclusive with [separator](#separator) and [parse delimited](#parse-delimited)

#### Enumeration

The `enums` attribute, if present, specifies enumerated values that the option accepts as parameter.
Any parameter that does not equal one of these values (after normalization) will cause an error to
be thrown. Explicitly _not_ available for the [boolean option](#boolean-option). Mutually exclusive
with [regular expression](#regular-expression) and [numeric range](#numeric-range).

### String attributes

String-valued option types share a set of attributes, as described below.

#### Regular expression

The `regex` attribute, if present, specifies a regular expression that string parameters should
match. Any parameter that does _not_ match the regular expression (after normalization) will cause
an error to be thrown. Mutually exclusive with [enumeration](#enumeration).

#### Trim whitespace

The `trim` attribute, if present, indicates that string parameters will be trimmed (i.e., have
leading and trailing whitespace removed). This normalization is applied _before_ checking value
constraints.

#### Case conversion

The `case` attribute, if present, specifies the kind of case conversion to apply to string
parameters. Can be one of `'lower'{:ts}` (convert to lowercase) or `'upper'{:ts}` (convert to
uppercase). This normalization is applied _before_ checking value constraints.

### Number attributes

Number-valued option types share a set of attributes, as described below.

#### Numeric range

The `range` attribute, if present, specifies a (closed) numeric range that number parameters should
be within. Any parameter that is _not_ within the given range (after normalization) will cause an
error to be thrown. You may want to use `[-Infinity, Infinity]{:ts}` to disallow `NaN{:ts}`.
Mutually exclusive with [enumeration](#enumeration).

#### Rounding

The `round` attribute, if present, specifies the kind of rounding to apply to number parameters. Can
be one of `'trunc'{:ts}` (round towards zero), `'floor'{:ts}` (round down), `'ceil'{:ts}` (round up)
or `'round'{:ts}` (round to the nearest integer). This normalization is applied _before_ checking
value constraints.

### Array attributes

Array-valued option types share a set of attributes, as described below.

#### Separator

The `separator` attribute, if present, specifies a delimiter by which to split parameter values. If
specified, the option will accept a single parameter and not multiple parameters (we say that it is
_delimited_, rather than being _variadic_). It can be a string or a regular expression. Mutually
exclusive with [parse callback](#parse-callback) and [parse delimited](#parse-delimited).

#### Parse delimited

The `parseDelimited` attribute, if present, specifies a custom callback to parse the value of the
option parameter. It accepts three parameters:

- `values` - the values parsed up to the current iteration
- `name` - the option name, as was specified on the command-line
- `value` - the parameter string value

Notes about this callback:

- unlike [parse callback](#parse-callback) that returns a single value, this callback should return
  an array
- if specified, the option will accept a single parameter and not multiple parameters[^2]
- if asynchronous, and is called, then the resulting option value will be a promise
- mutually exclusive with [separator](#separator) and [parse callback](#parse-callback)

[^2]: we say that it is _delimited_, rather than _variadic_.

#### Remove duplicates

The `unique` attribute, if present, indicates that duplicate elements will be removed from the
option value. This normalization is applied _before_ checking the [count limit](#count-limit)
constraint.

#### Append values

The `append` attribute, if present, indicates that the option allows appending elements to its
value if specified multiple times on the command-line. Both the [unique](#unique) normalization and
the [count limit](#count-limit) constraint (if enabled) are applied after appendage.

#### Count limit

The `limit` attribute, if present, indicates the maximum allowed number of array elements. Any
parameter that causes the option value to _exceed_ the given limit (after normalization) will cause
an error to be thrown.

## Niladic options

Niladic options do not expect any parameter on the command-line. With the notable exception of the
[flag option](#flag-option), these options have _side-effects_, rather than an intrinsic value.

<Callout type="info">
  When bash completion is in effect, help and version options are _not_ processed.
</Callout>

### Help option

The **help** option is a convenient specialization of the [function option](#function-option) that
handles the formatting of help messages. Internally, it performs the following actions:

1. instantiate a [formatter](formatter.mdx) class with the provided (or default) configuration
2. get the formatted messages, one for each option group
3. assemble them into a single message interspersed with group headings
4. throw the resulting message

The application should catch the message and print it in a terminal. This option has the following
optional attributes.

#### Usage & footer

The `usage` attribute describes your CLI usage instructions. It goes before everything else in the
help message. The `footer` attribute is an afterword that can be used to insert a copyright notice
or reference to other media. Both attributes can include inline styles and will be formatted
according to [text formatting](styles.mdx#text-splitting) rules, unless the `noSplit` attribute is
set.

#### Format & heading style

The `format` attribute, if present, specifies the [help format](formatter.mdx#help-format)
configuration. The `headingStyle` attribute, if present, specifies a
[style](styles.mdx#styling-attributes) to be applied to group headings.

#### No text splitting

The `noSplit` attribute, if present, indicates that the usage, footer and heading texts should _not_
be split into words. This allows them to have custom indentation and prevents a colon from being
appended to group headings, but at the expense of losing the text wrapping feature.

### Version option

The **version** option is another specialization of the [function option](#function-option) that
throws a version message. You may specify either of the following attributes.

#### Semantic version

The `version` attribute is a semantic version or version information. Mutually exclusive with
[resolve callback](#resolve-callback).

#### Resolve callback

The `resolve` attribute is a resolution function scoped to the module where a `package.json` file
will be searched and read to extract its `version` field. You should use [`import.meta.resolve`].

[`import.meta.resolve`]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/import.meta/resolve

Notes about this callback:

- for use in non-browser environments only
- it results in an asynchronous operation, so you should await the result of
  [`parseAsync`](parser.mdx#executing-callbacks)
- mutually exclusive with [semantic version](#semantic-version)

### Function option

The **function** option executes a generic callback function and saves its result as the option
value. You can use it to perform many kinds of useful things, such as:

- reading configuration from a file
- altering the values of previous options
- altering the option definitions in response to an option value
  - e.g., if `--verbose` is set, add more help items to the [help format](#format--heading-style)
    (or replace it altogether)

In addition to the set of [value attributes](#value-attributes) (minus the environemnt variable),
it has the following attributes.

#### Execute callback

The `exec` attribute is the callback function that should be executed. It is required and accepts
three parameters:

- `values` - the values parsed up to the current iteration
- `comp` - `true{:ts}` if performing completion (but not in the current iteration)
- `rest` - the remaining command-line arguments

Notes about this callback:

- it should return the option value or `void{:ts}`
- if asynchronous, you should await the result of [`parseAsync`](parser.mdx#executing-callbacks)
- altering the `rest` parameter will have _no_ effect on the original command-line arguments

<Callout type="default">
  Inside this callback, you may check whether an option has been specified before it by comparing
  its value with `undefined{:ts}`. This works because default values are only set at the end of the
  parsing loop.
</Callout>

#### Break loop

The `break` attribute, if present, tells the parser to exit the parsing loop immediately after
returning from the callback.

<Callout type="warning">
  When setting this attribute, the requirements of all options specified up to the current iteration
  (including the function option) will be verified. Hence, you should make it clear in the help
  message that any option required by the affected one must be specified _before_ it.
</Callout>

### Command option

The **command** option is yet another specialization of the [function option](#function-option) that
handles the execution of a "nested" command. It lets you specify the command's options in one of its
attributes and parses the remaining arguments.

<Callout type="default">
  As you might have guessed, this option allows the definition of hierarchical commands, including
  _recursive_ ones. This is explained in detail in the [commands guide](../guides/commands.mdx).
</Callout>

In addition to the set of [value attributes](#value-attributes) (minus the environemnt variable),
it has the following required attributes.

#### Command callback

The `cmd` attribute is the callback function that should be executed. It accepts two parameters:

- `values` - the values parsed for the parent command
- `cmdValues` - the values parsed for the command

Notes about this callback:

- it should return the option value or `void{:ts}`
- if asynchronous, you should await the result of [`parseAsync`](parser.mdx#executing-callbacks)
- when bash completion is in effect, this callback will _not_ be called
- if called, the parser will exit the parsing loop immediately upon its return

<Callout type="default">
  The simplest implementation would just return `cmdValues`. This way, they are stored in the option
  value and can be handled after the parser returns from the parsing loop.
</Callout>

#### Command options | callback

The `options` attribute is the set of option definitions for the command. You may also specify a
(non-asynchronous) callback that returns the option definitions (this allows the implementation of
[recursive commands](../guides/commands.mdx)).

<Callout type="warning">
  All incoming arguments will be parsed using the option definitions from this attribute, not those
  in which the option was declared. Hence, you should make it clear in the help message that all
  arguments pertaining to the command must be specified _after_ it.
</Callout>

### Flag option

The **flag** option is unique in the sense that it is both niladic and has an intrinsic value
(boolean). It differs from the [boolean option](#boolean-option) in that it does _not_ expect a
parameter.

<Callout type="info">
  We could have reused the boolean option for this purpose and made the parameter optional, but it
  would complicate the parser implementation. One benefit of this "limitation" is that it avoids
  ambiguity of whether arguments are positional or not (e.g., in `-f 1`, would `1` be a parameter to
  `-f` or a positional argument?).
</Callout>

In addition to the set of [value attributes](#value-attributes), it has the following optional
attribute.

#### Negation names

The `negationNames` attribute specifies alternate option names that can be used to turn the option
value `false{:ts}` (e.g., _--no-flag_). This is particularly useful in scripting scenarios where a
flag that has been previously specified must be reset by a supplementary list of arguments.

## Non-niladic options

### Boolean option

The **boolean** option has the set of [parameter attributes](#parameter-attributes) for a
`boolean{:ts}` data type, as well as the set of [value attributes](#value-attributes).

### String option

The **string** option has the set of [parameter attributes](#parameter-attributes) for a
`string{:ts}` data type, as well as the sets of [value attributes](#value-attributes) and
[string attributes](#string-attributes).

### Number option

The **number** option has the set of [parameter attributes](#parameter-attributes) for a
`number{:ts}` data type, as well as the sets of [value attributes](#value-attributes) and
[number attributes](#number-attributes).

### Strings option

The **strings** option has the set of [parameter attributes](#parameter-attributes) for a
`string[]{:ts}` data type, as well as the sets of [value attributes](#value-attributes),
[string attributes](#string-attributes) and [array attributes](#array-attributes).

### Numbers option

The **numbers** option has the set of [parameter attributes](#parameter-attributes) for a
`number[]{:ts}` data type, as well as the sets of [value attributes](#value-attributes),
[number attributes](#number-attributes) and [array attributes](#array-attributes).
