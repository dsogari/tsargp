# Styles

The `Style` type is a string literal consisting of a Select Graphic Rendition ([SGR]) sequence. It
can be used to customize the display of text in a terminal.

## Styling attributes

The `style` function accepts a list of styling attributes and creates a `Style` that can be used in
any part of the API that expects this type, or it can be embedded directly in text attributes, such
as the [synopsis and deprecation reason], [help section texts], [error phrases] and [help phrases].

Styles are cumulative, i.e., they can be combined with previous styles depending on the kind of
styling attribute. For instance, if the style of an option's description is `tf.bold` and the
style of number values is `fg.yellow`, then any number value that appears in the option
description (except those embedded in text attributes) is rendered in bold intensity with yellow
foreground color.

In the next sections we present the various styling attributes available.

<Callout type="warning">
  Not all of the attributes are supported in every terminal, so you should experiment with them
  before committing your code.
</Callout>

### Type faces

The `tf` enumeration declares text type faces that can be combined together. Here is the full list:

- `clear` - reset or normal (resets any other preceding SGR attribute)
- enable attributes:
  - `bold` - bold or increased intensity
  - `faint` - faint, decreased intensity, or dim
  - `italic` - italic
  - `underlined` - underlined
  - `slowlyBlinking` - slowly blinking
  - `rapidlyBlinking` - rapidly blinking
  - `inverse` - reverse video or inverse (flips foreground and background color)
  - `invisible` - invisible, concealed or hidden
  - `crossedOut` - crossed-out or strikethrough
  - `doublyUnderlined` - doubly underlined
  - `proportionalSpacing` - proportional spacing
- change font:
  - `primaryFont` - primary font
  - `alternative[1-9]` - alternative font 1 through 9
  - `fraktur` - black-letter font
- disable attributes:
  - `notBoldOrFaint` - normal intensity (neither bold nor faint)
  - `notItalicNorFraktur` - regular face (neither italic nor black-letter)
  - `notUnderlined` - not underlined
  - `notBlinking` - steady (not blinking)
  - `notInverse` - positive (not inverse)
  - `notInvisible` - visible (reveal, or not hidden)
  - `notCrossedOut` - not crossed out (no strikethrough)
  - `notProportionalSpacing` - disable proportional spacing
- framing:
  - `framed` - framed
  - `encircled` - encircled
  - `overlined` - overlined
  - `notFramedOrEncircled` - neither framed nor encircled
  - `notOverlined` - not overlined
- ideogram attributes:
  - `ideogramUnderline` - ideogram underline or right side line
  - `ideogramDoubleUnderline` - ideogram double underline, or double line on the right side
  - `ideogramOverline` - ideogram overline or left side line
  - `ideogramDoubleOverline` - ideogram double overline, or double line on the left side
  - `ideogramStressMarking` - ideogram stress marking
  - `noIdeogram` - no ideogram attributes
- superscript or subscript:
  - `superscript` - superscript
  - `subscript` - subscript.
  - `notSuperscriptOrSubscript` - neither superscript nor subscript

### Predefined text colors

The `fg` and `bg` enumerations declare predefined foreground and background colors, respectively:

- `default` - the default color
- standard colors:
  - `black` - black
  - `red` - red
  - `green` - green
  - `yellow` - yellow
  - `blue` - blue
  - `magenta` - magenta
  - `cyan` - cyan
  - `white` - white
- high-intensity colors:
  - `brightBlack` - bright black (gray)
  - `brightRed` - bright red
  - `brightGreen` - bright green
  - `brightYellow` - bright yellow
  - `brightBlue` - bright blue
  - `brightMagenta` - bright magenta
  - `brightCyan` - bright cyan
  - `brightWhite` - bright white

### Extended text colors

In addition to predefined colors, there are three utility functions to get custom 8-bit colors:

- `fg8` - creates a foreground color from an 8-bit decimal value
- `bg8` - creates a background color from an 8-bit decimal value
- `ul8` - creates an underline color from an 8-bit decimal value

### Underline styles

The `ul` constant holds the styles of underlined text:

- `none` - no underline
- `single` - single underline
- `double` - double underline
- `curly` - curly underline
- `dotted` - dotted underline
- `dashed` - dashed underline

## Terminal strings

The `TerminalString` class is an internal component that handles the construction of strings that
can be printed in a terminal. It has methods to split, append and wrap strings, with or without
control sequences, and is used both by the [parser] (to create error and warning messages) and by
the [formatter] (to build help messages).

The main logic implemented in this class is divided into _splitting_ and _wrapping_, as is explained
below.

### Text splitting

Text is split on paragraph, list item and word boundaries using a combination of simple regular
expressions. The following features are supported in text splitting.

#### Format specifiers

Format specifiers, prefixed with a percent sign `%`, can be extracted from the text and processed by
a formatting callback. This is used in different places in the library:

- by the parser to produce error messages based on configured [error phrases]
- by the formatter to assemble help items from configured [help phrases]
- by the formatter to create group headings from configured [heading phrases]

This particular feature is only available in _phrases_, not in text attributes of option definitions.
The specifiers get replaced with a value (or values, in case of arrays). The available ones are:

- `b` - a boolean value
- `s` - a string value
- `n` - a number value
- `r` - a regular expression
- `o` - an option name
- `v` - a generic value enclosed in angle brackets (like the [parameter column])
- `u` - a URL hyperlink
- `t` - general text
- `p` - a previously formatted string

If a phrase supports values, the specifier can be used to indicate where in the phrase to place the
value. If a phrase has multiple alternatives depending on the context, different texts may be
specified separated with `'|'{:ts}` and grouped in parentheses. Specifiers may also end with a
single digit that represents a predefined value in an error message or help item.

#### Inline styles

Text can contain inline styles. This applies as well to phrases as to text attributes, which the
formatter splits into words before adding to the option description.

When splitting text, the terminal string instance will try its best to preserve styles. However,
if you find some corner case that is not currently covered by the unit tests, please submit a [bug
report].

<Callout type="warning">
  Phrases can contain inline styles, but not in the same word as a format specifier. Otherwise, they
  will mess up the text wrapping. For example, the following phrase is not valid:
  ``` `Requires ${style(tf.bold)}%v`{:ts} ```. You should insert a space in between.
</Callout>

#### Paragraphs and lists

Although markdown syntax is not currently supported, paragraphs and itemized/numbered lists are
formatted similarly to how they would be in markdown. For example, the following text

```ansi
A paragraph with
  single line breaks,  redundant  spacing  and:
    - itemized; or
  1. numbered lists

  Another paragraph
```

Would be rendered as:

```ansi
A paragraph with single line breaks, redundant spacing and:
- itemized; or
1. numbered lists

Another paragraph
```

### Text wrapping

Text is wrapped according to a configured _width_: the number of terminal columns by which to limit
each line of text.

When a width of zero or `undefined{:ts}` is provided (which may happen if the output is being
redirected), the terminal string instance will avoid wrapping and will suppress control sequences
that would otherwise be used to render text in a terminal.

The following features are supported in text wrapping.

#### Indentation level

A terminal string optionally has an indentation level: the starting column respective to the first
terminal column.

When wrapping text to a desired width, the terminal string instance will try to respect this
setting, but if the desired width does not accommodate the text while respecting its indentation
level, the text is instead wrapped relative to the beginning of each line.

#### Text alignment

A terminal string optionally has a flag that indicates whether the text should be aligned to the
terminal's right boundary when being wrapped. This feature is used by the formatter in the help's
[description column].

## Terminal messages

The `TerminalMessage` is a base class that wraps a list of terminal strings. It provides a `wrap`
method to get a normal string compiled from the list. This method accepts two optional parameters:

- `width` - the terminal width (defaults to `0`)
- `emitStyles` - whether styles should be emitted

The default value of `emitStyles` depends on a few environment variables:

- `FORCE_COLOR` - force _emission_ of styles regardless of the terminal width
- `NO_COLOR` - force _omission_ of styles regardless of the terminal width
- `TERM` - set to `'dumb'{:ts}` to achieve the same behavior as `NO_COLOR`

Generally, you should not alter the returned string after being wrapped, as this will mess the
disposition of text in the terminal. If you do need to, you can _prepend_ additional text ending
with a line feed character `'\n'{:ts}`, or _append_ text starting with a line feed, as this will
preserve the disposition of wrapped text.

<Callout type="default">
  Alternatively, you can retrieve the underlying terminal string instances from the list and
  manipulate them before converting the message to string.
</Callout>

### Default width

In addition to the `wrap` mtehod, this class overrides the `toString` method and provides a
`message` property, both of which can be used to obtain a string wrapped with a default terminal
width.

The default width depends on the kind of message: in the case of `TerminalMessage`, it is
`process.stdout.columns{:ts}` (the width of the standard _output_ stream). Therefore, this kind of
message should be printed with `console.log` or equivalent, unless you are calling `wrap` directly.

<Callout type="info">
  When redirecting the output of a command to a file, the associated stream will not have the 
  `columns` property. Hence, if `stdout` is being redirected, the default value used by the above
  procedure will be `undefined{:ts}` (thus disabling wrapping and, possibly, omitting styles).
</Callout>

### Help message

The `HelpMessage` class is analog to the above one, but used specifically for help messages. It
should be printed with `console.log` or equivalent.

### Warning message

The `WarnMessage` class is a specialization of a terminal message that uses the width of the
standard _error_ stream (`process.stderr.columns{:ts}`) as the default width. It should be printed
with `console.error` or equivalent.

### Error message

The `ErrorMessage` class is a specialization of a warning message that actually derives from the
standard `Error` class. It should be printed with `console.error` or equivalent.

### Completion words

The `CompletionMessage` class represents a list of bash completion words. It inherits from a string
array and, on Linux, produces a string with the words separated by line feeds. It should be printed
with `console.log` or equivalent.

### Version message

The `VersionMessage` class currently derives from `String`, so it has no wrapping. However, it may
be remodeled in future versions of the library to accommodate new features. It should be printed
with `console.log` or equivalent.

<Callout type="default">
  Messages produced by the library are instances of one of the classes described above. So you
  can check the kind of a captured message through `instanceof{:ts}`.
