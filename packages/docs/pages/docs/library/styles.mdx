# Styles

The `Style` type is a string literal consisting of Select Graphic Rendition ([SGR]) sequences. It
can be used to customize the display of text in terminals that support it.

## Styling attributes

The `style` function accepts a list of styling attributes and creates a `Style` that can be used in
any part of the API that expects this type, or it can be embedded directly in text attributes, such
as the [synopsis and deprecation] notice, [help section] texts, [error phrases] and [help phrases].

Styles are cumulative, i.e., they can be combined with previous styles depending on the kind of
styling attribute. For instance, if the style of an option's description is `tf.bold{:ts}` and the
style of number values is `fg.yellow{:ts}`, then any number value (except those embedded in text
attributes) that appears in the option description will be rendered in bold intensity with yellow
foreground color.

In the next sections we present the various styling attributes available.

<Callout type="warning">
  Not all of the attributes are supported in every terminal, so you should experiment with them
  before committing your code.
</Callout>

### Type faces

The `tf` enumeration declares text type faces that can be combined together. They are listed below.

- `invisible` - invisible, concealed or hidden
- `crossedOut` - crossed-out or strikethrough
- `doublyUnderlined` - doubly underlined
- `proportionalSpacing` - proportional spacing

#### Font-changing attributes

- `primaryFont` - primary font
- `alternative[1-9]` - alternative font 1 through 9
- `fraktur` - black-letter font

### Predefined text colors

The `fg` and `bg` enumerations declare predefined foreground and background colors, respectively.
They both have the same colors, which are listed below.

- `default` - the default color

#### Standard colors

- `black` - black
- `red` - red
- `green` - green
- `yellow` - yellow
- `blue` - blue
- `magenta` - magenta
- `cyan` - cyan
- `white` - white

#### High-intensity colors

- `brightBlack` - bright black (gray)
- `brightRed` - bright red
- `brightGreen` - bright green
- `brightYellow` - bright yellow
- `brightBlue` - bright blue
- `brightMagenta` - bright magenta
- `brightCyan` - bright cyan
- `brightWhite` - bright white

### Extended text colors

In addition to predefined colors, there are three utility functions to get custom 8-bit colors:

- `fg8` - creates a foreground color from an 8-bit decimal value
- `bg8` - creates a background color from an 8-bit decimal value
- `ul8` - creates an underline color from an 8-bit decimal value

### Underline styles

The `ul` constant holds the styles of underlined text:

- `none` - no underline
- `single` - single underline
- `double` - double underline
- `curly` - curly underline
- `dotted` - dotted underline
- `dashed` - dashed underline

## Terminal strings

The `TerminalString` class is an internal component that handles the construction of strings that
can be printed on a terminal. It has methods to split, append and wrap strings, with or without
control sequences, and is used by the library in different places:

- by both the [parser] and [validator], to create error and warning messages
- by the [formatter], to build help messages

The main logic implemented in this class is divided into _splitting_ and _wrapping_, as is explained
in the next sections.

### Text splitting

Text is split into paragraphs, list items and words using a combination of simple regular
expressions. The features supported in text splitting are described below.

#### Format specifiers

During splitting, format specifiers prefixed with a percent sign `%` may be extracted from the text
and processed by a formatting callback. This is used by the library in different places:

- by the both the [parser] and [validator], to produce error and warning messages based on
  configured [error phrases]
- by the [formatter], to assemble help items from configured [help phrases]

This particular feature is only available in _phrases_, not in text attributes of option definitions.
Specifiers are meant to be replaced with a value (or values, in case of arrays). The available ones
are:

- `b` - a boolean value
- `s` - a string value
- `n` - a number value
- `r` - a regular expression
- `o` - an option name
- `v` - an unknown value (enclosed in angle brackets, like the [parameter column])
- `u` - a URL hyperlink
- `t` - a general text
- `p` - a previously formatted string

If a phrase supports values, the specifier can be used to indicate where in the phrase to place the
value. If a phrase has multiple alternatives (depending on the context), different texts may be
specified separated by a vertical bar and grouped in parentheses, e.g. `'(...|...)'{:ts}`.
Specifiers may also end with a single digit that represents a predefined value in an error message
or help item.

#### Inline styles

Text can contain inline styles. This applies as well to phrases as to text attributes, which the
formatter splits into words before adding to the help message.

When splitting text, the terminal string will try its best to preserve styles. However, if you find
some corner case that is not currently covered by our unit tests, please submit a [bug report].

<Callout type="warning">
  Phrases can contain inline styles, but not in the _same_ word as a format specifier. Otherwise,
  they will mess up the text wrapping. For example, the following phrase is not valid:
  ``` `Requires ${style(tf.bold)}%p`{:ts} ```. You must insert a space in-between.
</Callout>

#### Paragraphs and lists

Although markdown syntax is not currently supported, paragraphs and itemized/numbered lists are
formatted similarly to how they would be in markdown. For example, the following text

```ansi
A paragraph with
  single line breaks,  redundant  spacing  and:
    - itemized; or
  1. numbered lists

  Another paragraph
```

Would be rendered as:

```ansi
A paragraph with single line breaks, redundant spacing and:
- itemized; or
1. numbered lists

Another paragraph
```

### Text wrapping

Text is wrapped according to a configured _width_, i.e., the number of terminal columns by which to
limit each line of text.

When a width of zero or `undefined{:ts}` is provided (which may happen if the output is being
redirected), the terminal string will avoid wrapping and will suppress some control sequences that
would otherwise be used to render the text in a terminal.

The following features are supported in text wrapping.

#### Indentation level

A terminal string optionally has an indentation level, i.e., the starting column of the text
content, relative to the first terminal column.

When wrapping text to the desired width, the terminal string will attempt to respect this setting,
but if the desired width does not accommodate the length of the largest word while respecting the
string's indentation level, it will instead wrap lines relatively to the first terminal column.

#### Text alignment

A terminal string has an optional flag that indicates whether the text should be aligned to the
terminal's right boundary when being wrapped. This feature is used by the formatter in the help
message's [description column].

## Messages

There are different kinds of text content that an application might print in a terminal. We call
them "messages" and provide a specific class for each kind of message that the library may produce.
For convenience, all message classes have a `toString` method and a `message` property, both of
which can be used to obtain a normal `string{:ts}`.

<Callout type="default">
  All messages produced by the library are instances of one of the classes described below. So you
  can check the kind of a captured message through `instanceof{:ts}`.
</Callout>

### User-facing messages

User-facing messages are meant to be consumed by humans. Each kind of message uses a default
terminal width to render the resulting string. They are described below.

#### ANSI message

The `AnsiMessage` is a base class that wraps a list of terminal strings. It provides a `wrap` method
to get a normal string compiled from the list. This method accepts two optional parameters:

- `width` - the terminal width
- `emitStyles` - whether styles should be emitted

The default value of `emitStyles` depends on a few environment variables:

- `FORCE_COLOR` - force _emission_ of styles regardless of the terminal width
- `NO_COLOR` - force _omission_ of styles regardless of the terminal width
- `TERM` - set to `'dumb'{:ts}` to achieve the same behavior as `NO_COLOR`

Generally, you should not alter the returned string after being wrapped, as this will mess up the
disposition of text in the terminal. If you do need to, you can _prepend_ additional text ending
with a line feed character `'\n'{:ts}`, or _append_ text starting with a line feed, as this will
preserve the disposition of wrapped text.

<Callout type="default">
  Alternatively, you can retrieve the underlying terminal string instances from the list and
  manipulate them before converting the message to string.
</Callout>

The default terminal width used by this class is that of the standard _output_ stream
(`process.stdout.columns{:ts}`). Therefore, this kind of message should be printed with
`console.log` or equivalent, unless you are calling `wrap` directly.

<Callout type="info">
  When redirecting the output of a command (e.g., writing to a file or piping to another command),
  the associated stream will not have a `columns` property, thus disabling wrapping and, possibly,
  omitting styles.
</Callout>

#### Warning message

The `WarnMessage` class is a specialization of the ANSI message that uses the width of the standard
_error_ stream (`process.stderr.columns{:ts}`) by default. It should be printed with `console.error`
or equivalent.

#### Error message

The `ErrorMessage` class is a specialization of a warning message that actually derives from the
standard `Error` class. It should be printed with `console.error` or equivalent.

#### Version message

A version message is a plain `string{:ts}`, so it has no wrapping. However, it may be remodeled in
future versions of the library to accommodate new features. It should be printed with `console.log`
or equivalent.

### Machine-readable messages

Machine-readable messages are meant to be consumed by computers. They are described below.

#### JSON message

The `JsonMessage` class represents a message in JSON format. It is intended for consumption by
introspection tools and other text-processing applications. It should be printed with
`console.log` or equivalent.

#### Text message

The `TextMessage` class represents a list of text lines. It is used by the library in two places:

- by the [parser] to throw [completion words], in which case it is meant to be consumed by the
  completion builtins
- by the [formatter] to create help messages in either CSV or Markdown [format]

This message produces a string with lines separated by line feeds, and should be printed with
`console.log` or equivalent.
