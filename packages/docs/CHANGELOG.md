### Patch Changes

- [#30](https://github.com/trulysimple/tsargp/pull/30) [`e9d8c9b`](https://github.com/trulysimple/tsargp/commit/e9d8c9bcb4b464345689025e73cbc9a6019615e5) Thanks [@disog](https://github.com/disog)! - A new page was added in the project website for code documentation generated with [TypeDoc](https://typedoc.org/).

## 0.1.46

### Patch Changes

- [#29](https://github.com/trulysimple/tsargp/pull/29) [`065bc1b`](https://github.com/trulysimple/tsargp/commit/065bc1b6ec941a5ca3a9b5df238339fa76b43a57) Thanks [@disog](https://github.com/disog)! - You can now set environment variables in the demo (e.g., `NO_COLOR=1`). This works even when performing completion. One caveat though: if you set variables inline with a command (e.g., `VAR1=1 VAR2=2 <cmd> ...`) they will persist through future invocations of any command. To reset variables, use the syntax `VAR=`.
