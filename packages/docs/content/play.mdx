> Terminal emulation has limited capabilities. Copy, paste, history, colorization, and completion all work, but not as seamlessly as in a real shell. For a smoother experience, you may want to try the demo locally:

## Things to try out

### Names validation

- check if an error is reported for duplicate option names
- check if an error is reported for duplicate cluster letters
- check if an error is reported for duplicate environment variable names

### Constraints validation

- check if an error is reported for duplicate parameter choices
- check if an error is reported for an invalid parameter count
- check if an error is reported for an invalid inline constraint
- check if an error is reported for an array-valued option with too many values in the default or example value, when configured with an element count

### Requirements validation

- check if an error is reported for an option requiring itself
- check if an error is reported for an option requiring an unknown option
- check if an error is reported for an option requiring a help or version option
- check if an error is reported for an option requiring an option that is always required

### Miscellaneous

- check if an error is reported for duplicate positional options
- check if an error is reported for an option that cannot be supplied

### Validation warnings

- check if a warning is reported for option names too similar to each other (e.g. `-help1` and `-help2`)
- check if a warning is reported for option names with mixed naming conventions (e.g. `-h` and `--b`)
- check if a warning is reported for a variadic option with cluster letters
