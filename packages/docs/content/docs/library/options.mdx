# Options

A command-line interface can be composed of subcommands and options (also known as _flags_). The options allow a calling application or user to configure the command that will run. **tsargp** offers a selection of option types that should suit most applications. In the next sections, we present the available types and describe them in detail.

## Option types

There are seven types of options, as summarized in the table below:

| Type       | Parameters                                        | Attribute classes                                         |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| [help]     | niladic                                           | [basic], [message]                                        |
| [version]  | niladic                                           | [basic], [message]                                        |
| [command]  | niladic[^1]                                       | [basic], [value],                                         |
| [flag]     | niladic                                           | [basic], [value], [environment]                           |
| [single]   | positional, inline, monadic                       | [basic], [value], [environment], [parameter], [selection] |
| [array]    | positional, inline, variadic, delimited, appended | [basic], [value], [environment], [parameter], [selection] |
| [function] | positional, inline, configurable                  | [basic], [value], [environment], [parameter]              |

The next sub-sections cover some concepts that may be used throughout this page.

### Option type

The `type` attribute of an option's definition indicates the type of the option. It is the _only_ required attribute of any option, and is used as a [discriminant] for determining the available attributes of a specific option.

### Option parameters

Each type of option expects different number of parameters on the command line:

- **niladic** - no parameter
- **monadic** - single parameter
- **variadic** - variable number of parameters
- **delimited** - values can be delimited with a [parameter separator]
- **appended** - can be specified multiple times and [append values]
- **configurable** - can be configured with a [parameter count]
- **inline** - allows parameters to be [inlined] with an option name

<Callout type="info">

When an option is specified multiple times on the command line, its value gets replaced each time. The only exception is the case of an array-valued option with [append values] set.

</Callout>

### Option value

The data type of an option value in the [resulting object] depends on the option type. You can check the effective data type of the option values for a set of option definitions by inspecting the IntelliSense output of:

- the result of the [`parse`] function
- the result of the `valuesFor` function
- a type alias for `OptionValues<typeof your_options>{:ts}`

<Callout type="info">

The initial value of any option is `undefined{:ts}`, except for help and version options without the [save message] attribute.

</Callout>

### Constraints

Non-niladic options can be configured with constraint attributes, which may be of two kinds:

- **parameter** constraint - a restriction applied to option parameters
- **value** constraint - a restriction applied to the parsed value(s)

## Attribute classes

This section classifies attributes according to the subset of option types to which they apply. The options themselves will be explained later in this page.

### Basic attributes

All options share a set of attributes in addition to their type. They are described below.

#### Option names

The `names` attribute lists the option names as they may appear on the command line (e.g., `-h` or `--help`). The following rules apply to option names:

- A name must not contain the equals sign `'='{:ts}`, since this character can be used as option-parameter separator.
- A name can contain whitespace or even be an empty string. (However, this may look strange in help messages.)
- A name can be `null{:ts}`, in which case the corresponding [name slot] will be skipped in the help message.

<Callout type="default">

This attribute can be safely omitted if the option may be specified through [positional] arguments or through the [environment].

</Callout>

#### Preferred name

The `preferredName` attribute is used for informational purposes. It is displayed in [messages] in cases where a name is not available, e.g., when evaluating option requirements or processing positional arguments. If not specified, the first name in the `names` array will be used.

<Callout type="info">

This attribute is not validated, so it can be any string.

</Callout>

#### Option synopsis

The `synopsis` attribute, if present, specifies a brief summary of the option's purpose. It will be formatted in the help message according to [text formatting] rules.

#### Deprecation notice

The `deprecated` attribute, if present, specifies the reason for the option being deprecated. It will be formatted in the help message according to [text formatting] rules.

<Callout type="default">

Deprecated options specified on the command line generate a [warning message], which you may want to print in the terminal. It can be obtained by destructuring the result of the [`parseInto`] function.

</Callout>

#### Group | hide

The `group` attribute, if present, specifies the name of a group under which the option should appear in the help message. Alternatively, you can use the value `null{:ts}` to completely hide it from the help message.

<Callout type="default">

You can assign a unique group to the [positional] option (if there is one) and place it _first_ in the option definitions, in order to highlight it in the help message.

</Callout>

#### Display styles

The `styles` attribute, if present, specifies custom [styling attributes] for each of the option's [help columns]. It has the following optional properties:

- `names` - the style of the option names
- `param` - the style of the option parameter
- `descr` - the style of the option description

#### Hyperlink

The `link` attribute, if present, specifies the URL of an external resource or media. It will be included in the option's description in the help message.

### Message attributes

Both the help and version options share the attribute described below.

#### Save message

By default, the option will _throw_ the generated message, as a convenient way for the application to print it in the terminal. However, this behavior can be changed with the `saveMessage` attribute. If present, it indicates that the message should be saved as the option value instead of being thrown.

### Value attributes

All options that may have a value share a set of attributes, which are described below.

#### Cluster letters

The `cluster` attribute, if present, specifies letters that can be used to combine options into a single command-line argument. This feature is also known as the [short-option] style, and can be enabled via the [cluster prefix] parsing flag.

<Callout type="info">

Cluster letters should _not_ be included in the list of [option names], although they are subject to the same restrictions.

</Callout>

Here is an example that illustrates how it works. Suppose we have the following options:

- [flag] option, with name `'--flag'{:ts}` and letters `'fF'{:ts}`
- [single] option, with name `'--str'{:ts}` and letters `'sS'{:ts}`
- [array] option, with name `'--num'{:ts}` and letters `'nN'{:ts}`

Given these options, the following invocations would be equivalent:

```sh
cli -fSN 'my string' 1 2 3
cli -Fsn 'my string' 1 2 3
```

They would be transformed into their "canonical" form, i.e.:

```sh
cli --flag --str 'my string' --num 1 2 3
```

##### Cluster parsing rules

The following rules apply to cluster arguments:

- the _order_ of options in a cluster is preserved when converting to the canonical form
- variadic options and subcommands are supported, but they must come _last_ in a cluster
- if word completion is attempted for a cluster, the default completion message is thrown
- if a nameless positional option appears in a cluster, its argument will be treated as positional

##### Cluster inline parameters

Cluster arguments may be considered to have an inline parameter if they contain at least one unknown letter that is _not the first_. For example, using the same option definitions as above, the command line `cli -s'my str' -n123{:sh}` would be parsed as `cli --str 'my str' --num 123{:sh}`.

Notice how the parameters appear "glued" to the cluster letter, with no intervening space, and they contain characters that are not valid cluster letters. However, the first letter _must_ be valid for the argument to be considered a cluster argument.

<Callout type="info">

This feature is affected by the [inline constraint].

</Callout>

#### Always required

The `required` attribute, if present, indicates that the option is _always_ required, regardless of other options.

<Callout type="info">

Mutually exclusive with [default value] and [conditional requirements].

</Callout>

<Callout type="default">

When using this attribute, we recommend also setting [preferred name] to some explanatory name.

</Callout>

#### Forward requirements

The `requires` attribute, if present, specifies requirements that must be satisfied _if_ the option is specified, either on the command line or through the [environment]. Its value can be either:

- an option **key**;
- an object that maps option keys to required **values**;
- a requirement **expression**; or
- a requirement **callback**

An option key means that the referenced option must also be specified (either on the command line or through the [environment]). In the case of an object, every referenced option must have the corresponding value, which can be any value accepted by that option, or one of the special values:

- `undefined{:ts}` to signify _presence_
- `null{:ts}` to signify _absence_

<Callout type="info">

You cannot reference options from a [subcommand] (parent or child) in a requirement. Option keys must always refer to options in the same level of definitions.

</Callout>

##### Requirement expression

You can also specify an expression, in which case it is evaluated as follows:

- `req.all{:ts}` - an expression that is satisfied when _all_ requirements are satisfied
- `req.one{:ts}` - an expression that is satisfied when at least _one_ requirement is satisfied
- `req.not{:ts}` - an expression that is satisfied when the requirement is _not_ satisfied.

##### Requirement callback

You can also specify a custom callback to evaluate requirements. It receives a single parameter which contains the parsed values, and should return a `boolean{:ts}` (or a promise thereof) indicating whether the requirements were satisfied. It may perform any kind of verification, such as inspect parsed values, check the environment, etc.

It may be configured with a custom `toString` method to render it in error and help messages, e.g.:

```ts
options.flag.requires.toString = () => 'this and that ...';
```

#### Conditional requirements

The `requiredIf` attribute is reciprocal to the previous one: if present, it specifies requirements that must be satisfied for the affected option to be _considered_ required.

<Callout type="info">

Mutually exclusive with [always required].

</Callout>

An example might help elucidate this distinction. Suppose we have these requirements:

```ts
req.all(
  'option1',
  req.one({ option2: null }, req.not({ option3: [2] })),
  (values) => values['option1'] === values['option3'],
);
```

If they were declared in the `requires` attribute, they would mean:

> _If this option is specified, then the following must hold true: `option1` must be present AND (`option2` must be absent OR `option3` must have a value different than `[2]`) AND `option1` must have the same value as `option3`._

And if they were declared in the `requiredIf` attribute, they would mean:

> _If `option1` is present AND (`option2` is absent OR `option3` has a value different than `[2]`) AND `option1` has the same value as `option3`, then this option is considered required and must be specified._

<Callout type="info">

An option is considered specified if it either appears on the command line or has data coming from the [environment].

</Callout>

#### Default value

The `default` attribute, if present, specifies a value (or a promise thereof) to be used at the end of the parsing loop, in case the option is specified neither on the command line nor in the [environment].

<Callout type="info">

Mutually exclusive with [always required].

</Callout>

##### Default value callback

In case the default value is not known beforehand, you can use a callback. It receives a single parameter containing the parsed values, and should return the default option value (or a promise thereof).

When rendering a help message, the formatter disregards any value returned by the callback, as it may depend on the values parsed from command-line arguments, which are not available when processing the help option.

On the other hand, the callback can be configured with a custom `toString` method, e.g.:

```ts
options.flag.default.toString = () => 'this and that ...';
```

#### Parsing callback

The `parse` attribute, if present, specifies a [custom callback] to parse the option's parameter(s). It should return the option value (or a promise thereof).

Depending on the option type, the callback receives a different kind of data in its first parameter. But its second parameter always contains the current [argument information], which includes the option's name, argument index and any previously parsed values.

If you need to throw an error from the callback, we recommend using the [error message]'s `createCustom` static method. It receives a custom phrase that is formatted similarly to [error phrases].

Within the callback, you can check whether an option has been specified before by comparing its value with `undefined{:ts}`. This works because default values are only set at the _end_ of the parsing loop.

### Environment attributes

Options that may read data from the environment share some attributes, as described below.

#### Accept input

The `stdin` attribute, if present, indicates that the option accepts data from the standard input. It will only have effect if the option is _not_ specified on the command line, otherwise the input stream will remain untouched.

The parser only reads _readily_ available data, without waiting for new input. This means that it can only extract data from redirected command outputs, not from interactive terminals. For the latter effect, you should use a [default value callback] in conjunction with third-party prompting libraries.

<Callout type="info">

This attribute has precedence over [data sources].

</Callout>

<Callout type="default">

You can omit the [option names] or [hide] the option from the help message, if you want its value to be read _exclusively_ from the standard input.

</Callout>

#### Data sources

The `sources` attribute, if present, specifies names of environment data sources from which the option value should be read, in case it is specified neither on the command line nor in the [standard input].

Sources are tried in the specified order. A `string{:ts}` means an environment _variable_, while a `URL{:ts}` indicates the path of a _local file_.

<Callout type="info">

If data is found in a source, the affected option will be considered as if specified on the command line, which has implications for evaluating the option's requirements.

</Callout>

#### Break loop

The `break` attribute indicates whether the parser should exit the parsing loop after returning from a [parsing callback].

<Callout type="warning">

When setting this attribute, the requirements of all options specified up to the current argument will be verified. Hence, you should make it clear in the help message that any options required by the affected one must be specified _before_ it.

</Callout>

### Parameter attributes

All non-niladic options share a set of attributes, which are described below.

#### Example value

The `example` attribute, if present, specifies a value to appear in the help message [parameter column].

<Callout type="info">

Mutually exclusive with [parameter name].

</Callout>

#### Parameter name

The `paramName` attribute, if present, specifies a name to appear in the help message [parameter column].

<Callout type="info">

Mutually exclusive with [example value].

</Callout>

#### Positional | marker

The `positional` attribute, if present, indicates that the option accepts _positional_ arguments. There may be at most _one_ option with this setting in the same level of definitions.

If set to `true{:ts}`, then any argument not recognized as an option name will be considered positional. If set to a string, then it acts as a positional marker, in which case all arguments that appear _beyond_ the marker will be considered positional.

<Callout type="default">

When using this attribute, we recommend also setting [preferred name] to some explanatory name.

</Callout>

<Callout type="info">

The positional marker should _not_ be included in the list of [option names], although it is subject to the same restrictions.

</Callout>

#### Inline constraint

The `inline` attribute, if present, indicates the option's treatment of [inline parameters]. It can be either `false{:ts}` to disallow, or `'always'{:ts}` to _always_ require inline parameters. By default, parameters are allowed (but not required) to be inlined with option names.

#### Completion callback

The `complete` attribute, if present, specifies a custom callback for [word completion], which can be used to make better suggestions than the built-in algorithm would for the option. It receives two parameters:

- `param` - the word being completed
- `info` - the current [argument information]

It should return the list of completion words (or a promise thereof). If an error is thrown, it will be ignored and the default completion message will be thrown instead.

### Selection attributes

Both single- and array-valued options can have additional parameter constraints, for which they share the set of attributes described below.

#### Regular expression

The `regex` attribute, if present, specifies a regular expression that the option's parameter(s) should match. Any parameter that does _not_ match the regex (after applying any [normalization]) will cause an error to be raised.

<Callout type="info">

Mutually exclusive with [parameter choices].

</Callout>

#### Parameter choices

The `choices` attribute, if present, specifies string values that the option accepts as parameter(s). Any parameter that does not match one of these values (after applying any [normalization]) will cause an error to be raised. They are also considered by the [completion algorithm] when a parameter is being completed.

<Callout type="info">

Mutually exclusive with [regular expression].

</Callout>

#### Parameter mapping

The `mapping` attribute, if present, specifies a record that maps parameter values to option values. In this case, if a parameter matches one of the keys (after applying any [normalization]), it will get mapped to the corresponding value; otherwise it will be forwarded to the [parsing callback], if specified.

#### Parameter normalization

The `normalize` attribute, if present, specifies a normalization function applied to parameters before they get validated and/or parsed. This includes parsing of option parameters and performing [word completion].

## Niladic options

Niladic options do not expect any parameter on the command line.

### Help option

The **help** option handles the formatting of help messages. Internally, it instantiates a help [formatter] with the provided configuration, obtains the formatted message and throws it. The application is responsible for catching this message and printing it in a terminal.

<Callout type="info">

When [word completion] is in effect, this option will be _skipped_.

</Callout>

In addition to the sets of [basic] and [message] attributes, this option has the attributes described below.

#### Help layout

The `layout` attribute specifies a custom [help layout].

#### Help sections

The `sections` attribute specifies [help sections] to be rendered in the help message. By default, two are included:

- [usage section] - with `'Usage:'{:ts}` as heading, and content indented by 2 spaces
- [groups section] - with `'Options:'{:ts}` as the default group heading

#### Enable subcommand

The `useCommand` attribute is an opt-in feature that allows the next argument to be used as the name of a [subcommand] for which the help message should be generated. For example, the invocation `cli --help cmd` would throw the help of the `cmd` command, if it exists.

<Callout type="info">

If a subcommand with the specified name does not exist or does not have its own help, the argument may still be considered as an option filter when [enable option filter] is set.

</Callout>

#### Enable option filter

The `useFilter` attribute is an opt-in feature that allows the remaining arguments to be used as [option filter]. For example, the invocation `cli --help flag` would only include in the help message those options whose [names], [synopsis] or environment [data sources] match the regex `/flag/i{:ts}`.

<Callout type="default">

The two features above may be used together. For example, the invocation `cli --help cmd -f` would throw the help message of the `cmd` subcommand, filtered by option `-f`.

</Callout>

### Version option

The **version** option throws a version message. In addition to the sets of [basic] and [message] attributes, it has a single attribute described below.

<Callout type="info">

When [word completion] is in effect, this option will be _skipped_.

</Callout>

#### Version info

The `version` attribute specifies the version information. It accepts either of the following values:

- unstructured text data (e.g., a semantic version)
- the path of a JSON file whence a `version` field will be extracted

In the latter case, the path should generally be `'./package.json'{:ts}` and should be used in conjunction with the [resolution callback] parsing flag.

### Command option

The **command** option -- a.k.a. subcommand -- lets you specify a set of option definitions for which the parser should process the remaining arguments.

It will supply the [parsing callback] of the subcommand with the parsed values and subsequently exit the parsing loop. The option value will be either the result of the callback, if specified, or the parsed values themselves.

Values of _ancestor_ commands (i.e. non-immediate parents) cannot be accessed from within the callback. For this purpose, you will need to wait until the parsing procedure returns.

<Callout type="info">

When [word completion] is in effect, the parsing callback will _not_ be called, since completion will have occurred before it has a chance to execute.

</Callout>

In addition to the sets of [basic] and [value] attributes, it has the attributes described below.

#### Nested options

The `options` attribute, if present, specifies a set of option definitions for the subcommand. Its value can be either of:

- an object containing the option definitions (or a promise thereof)
- a callback that returns the option definitions (or a promise thereof)
- the path of a JavaScript module exporting the option definitions

A callback allows the implementation of [recursive commands], whereas a module path allows a [dynamic import]. The latter case should be used in conjunction with the [resolution callback] parsing flag. In either case, it is only evaluated once the affected option is parsed from the command line.

<Callout type="warning">

All incoming arguments will be parsed using the option definitions from this attribute, not from the parent command. Hence, you should make it clear in the help message that all arguments pertaining to the subcommand must be specified _after_ it.

</Callout>

#### Cluster prefix

The `clusterPrefix` attribute, if present, indicates whether the command accepts cluster arguments. It has the same semantics as the [cluster prefix] parsing flag, and must be used in conjunction with the [cluster letters] of the nested options.

<Callout type="info">

This attribute has precedence over [option prefix].

</Callout>

#### Option prefix

The `optionPrefix` attribute, if present, specifies the prefix for option names within the command. If set, then arguments starting with this prefix will be considered an option name, regardless of their position respective to other arguments in the command-line.

### Flag option

The **flag** option accepts no parameter, but has a value that will be either the result of the [parsing callback], if specified, or `true{:ts}`. The callback receives an empty string as its first parameter.

<Callout type="default">

If you need a boolean-valued option that accepts a single parameter, use the [single] option instead. To make the parameter optional, use the [function] option with a [parameter count] of `[0, 1]{:ts}`.

</Callout>

This option has the following sets of attributes:

- [basic] attributes
- [value] attributes
- [environment] attributes

<Callout type="info">

Old library versions provided an attribute to indicate alternate option names to turn the option value `false{:ts}` (e.g., _--no-flag_). This can now be achieved by inspecting the `name` property of the [argument information].

</Callout>

## Non-niladic options

Non-niladic options accept one or more parameters on the command line.

### Single-valued option

The **single** option accepts a single parameter. Its value can be either the result of the [parsing callback], one of the [parameter choices], one of the [parameter mapping] values or the parameter itself (by default).

The parsing callback receives a `string{:ts}` as first parameter, which is the option parameter, and should return the option value.

This option has the following sets of attributes:

- [basic] attributes
- [value] attributes
- [environment] attributes
- [parameter] attributes
- [selection] attributes

### Array-valued option

The **array** option accepts multiple (zero or more) parameters. Its value is an array whose elements can be either the result of the [parsing callback], one of the [parameter choices], one of the [parameter mapping] values or the parameters themselves (by default).

The parsing callback receives a `string{:ts}` as first parameter, which is a single option parameter, and should likewise return the value of a single array element. The resulting array may be normalized according to value constraints.

This option has the following sets of attributes:

- [basic] attributes
- [value] attributes
- [environment] attributes
- [parameter] attributes
- [selection] attributes
- the attributes described below

#### Parameter separator

The `separator` attribute, if present, specifies a delimiter by which to split the option parameters. It can be either a string or a regular expression.

<Callout type="info">

When _not_ using this attribute, we recommend setting the [inline constraint] to `false{:ts}`.

</Callout>

#### Remove duplicates

The `unique` attribute, if present, indicates that duplicate elements will be removed from the option value. This normalization is applied _before_ checking the [element count limit].

<Callout type="info">

Due to the nature of JavaScript's [Set], the order of elements is preserved (i.e., it reflects the order in which the arguments were parsed).

</Callout>

#### Append values

The `append` attribute, if present, indicates that the option allows appending elements to its value when specified multiple times on the command line. Any [duplicates] are removed after appendage, if enabled.

#### Element count limit

The `limit` attribute, if present, indicates the maximum allowed number of elements. Any [argument sequence] that causes the option value to _exceed_ the given limit (after removing any [duplicates]) will cause an error to be raised.

### Function option

The **function** option exists for the sole purpose of being configured with an expected parameter count, and is the only option that can accept between zero and one parameter. Its value will be either the result of the [parsing callback], if specified, or the parsed values themselves.

The callback receives a `string[]{:ts}` as first parameter, which contains the option parameters, and should return the option value. As a special case, this array may contain _all_ the remaining command-line arguments (see [parameter count] for details).

This option has the following sets of attributes:

- [basic] attributes
- [value] attributes
- [environment] attributes
- [parameter] attributes
- the attributes described below

#### Parameter count

The `paramCount` attribute, if present, specifies the number of parameters that the option expects. It can have either of the following values:

- **unspecified** or **negative**: the option accepts _unlimited_ parameters
- **zero**: the option accepts _unknown_ number of parameters (see below)
- **positive**: the option expects _exactly_ this amount
- **range**: the option expects between a _minimum_ and a _maximum_ count

In the special case of zero, the parsing callback will receive all remaining command-line arguments. It should be used in conjunction with the [skip count] attribute. Note that altering the string array inside the callback would have _no_ effect on the original arguments, as it is just a copy.

Note that this option cannot have a [parameter separator], since it would conflict with the parameter count. To see why, consider the case where the minimum count is 2. Then, the second argument following the option would always be treated as a parameter, regardless of whether it is the name of another option, _even if the previous argument had two delimited parameters_. This is because the parser does not look for delimiters when forming an [argument sequence].

<Callout type="warning">

If the data comes from the [environment], then the [parsing callback] will receive an array with a _single_ element as parameter, which may be less than the expected count. You should inspect the `index` property of the [argument information], which should be `NaN{:ts}` in this case.

</Callout>

#### Skip count

The `skipCount` attribute indicates the number of remaining arguments to skip, after returning from the [parsing callback]. This value is meant to be changed by the callback, and only works when the [parameter count] is zero.

It is useful in cases where the number of parameters is not known beforehand, and the callback wants to have control over where an [argument sequence] ends. Here is an example of how it might be used inside the callback:

```ts {6}
{
  // other attributes...
  parse(params) {
    const index = params.findIndex((val) => !val.startsWith('{')); // find first non-JSON param
    const count = index >= 0 ? index : params.length; // count how many there are
    this.skipCount = count; // <<-- tell the parser to skip them
    return params.slice(0, count).map((val) => JSON.parse(val)); // return the parsed values
  },
}
```

<Callout type="info">

When [word completion] is in effect, the last argument will be the word to complete (you can check if this is the case by inspecting the `comp` property of the [argument information]). If it pertains to the current argument sequence, you can throw completion words from the callback as an instance of the [text message].

</Callout>
