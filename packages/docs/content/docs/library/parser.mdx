# Parser

The `parser` module handles parsing of command-line arguments. It provides functions that accept a set of option [definitions] and parse arguments into option values. They may also produce error and warning messages, which can be customized via [message configuration].

## Option values

The result of argument parsing is a record containing one [option value] for each option. There are two ways to obtain these values, as explained below.

### Obtaining a fresh object

The `parse` function returns a promise that resolves to a [frozen] object containing the option values. It accepts the following parameters:

- `options` -- the option definitions (required)
- `cmdLine` -- the command line or list of command-line arguments (optional)
- `flags` -- an object containing the [parsing flags] (optional)

Normally you can leave the optional parameters undefined, as they have sensible default values. The command line defaults to the value of either the `COMP_LINE` or `BUFFER` environment variables (whichever is present) or to the process arguments:

```ts
process.env['COMP_LINE'] ?? process.env['BUFFER'] ?? process.argv.slice(2);
```

If you feel the need to configure the parsing procedure, make sure to first understand how [word completion] works.

### Using an existing object

The `parseInto` function is more flexible, as it allows you to pass an existing object or class instance, which will be filled with the parsed values. It accepts the same parameters as the previous one, except for an additional parameter:

- `values` -- the option values to parse into (required)

Existing values are preserved until they get overridden by the parsing procedure. When using TypeScript, this object will be type-checked against the expected type of option values for a given set of definitions. You can use the `valuesFor` function to create an object for just this purpose.

This function returns a promise that resolves to a `ParsingResult` object containing the following property:

- `warning` -- a [warning message] consisting of warnings encountered in the parsing procedure, if any

## Parsing flags

The parsing procedure can be configured via a `ParsingFlags` object that has some optional properties, as described below.

### Program name

The `progName` property is a custom name for the main command, and may be used in two places:

- in the [process title]; and
- in the [usage section] of help messages

It defaults to the _basename_ of the executing script, but can be suppressed by setting it to an empty string.

> [!NOTE]
>
> This flag is ignored when [word completion] is in effect.

### Completion index

The `compIndex` property is the cursor position in a command line for which the user pressed `<Tab>`. It defaults to the value of the `COMP_POINT` or `CURSOR` environment variables, or to the length of the `BUFFER` variable (whichever is present, otherwise `undefined{:ts}`):

```ts
Number(process.env['COMP_POINT'] ?? process.env['CURSOR']) || process.env['BUFFER']?.length;
```

When invoking the parsing procedure with a raw command line, and this flag is set, the parser will perform [word completion] for the argument overlapping this position.

### Cluster prefix

The `clusterPrefix` property specifies the prefix for cluster arguments. If set, then eligible arguments starting with this prefix may be considered a cluster. This must be used in conjunction with the [cluster letters] attribute.

Option names have precedence over the cluster prefix. For example, if the prefix is a single dash and there is an option named `'-flag'{:ts}`, then arguments matching this name will _not_ be considered a cluster. On the other hand, the cluster prefix has precedence over the [option prefix].

> [!TIP]
>
> The cluster prefix can be the empty string, in which case it behaves similarly to GNU's `tar` command.

### Option prefix

The `optionPrefix` property specifies the prefix for [option names]. If set, then arguments starting with this prefix will be considered an option name, regardless of their position respective to other arguments in the command-line.

### Standard input designator

The `stdinDesignator` property specifies a designator for the [standard input] to display in help messages produced by [help] options.

## Parsing features

The set of features supported by the parser are described below.

### Custom callbacks

Custom parsing operations are supported through the following types of callbacks:

- [requirement callback]
- [default value callback]
- [parsing callback]
- [completion callback]

All of these can be asynchronous, in which case the parser awaits their resolution, either because it needs the result or to avoid data races when reading and modifying the [option values].

Note that there is no synchronous version of the parsing procedure. This is a design choice: in order to support a fully synchronous `parse` function using the same code base, the parser would have to deal with returned promises in a way that would make it hard to maintain -- remember the classic [callback hell].

Besides, the asynchronous version has the benefit of allowing us to perform some operations, such as [requirements] checking, concurrently. This should not be a drawback for most applications, since argument parsing is usually done at the top-level of a module or script, where the `await{:ts}` primitive is readily available.

### Argument sequence

An argument sequence is the occurrence of an option in the command line with possible parameters. To determine the start end end of a sequence, the parser looks for [option names] or [positional] arguments once it finishes parsing the previous option, or if the latter is [variadic].

For example, if the option initiating a sequence is [array-valued], the parser starts looking for a new option as soon as it advances to the next argument, since that may be either an [option parameter] or the start of a new sequence.

The same is true for function options with a _variable_ [parameter count]. For example, if the option expects between 1 and 3 parameters, the parser treats the next argument as a parameter to the option, regardless of whether it is an option name. Once the first parameter is saved, the parser resumes searching for options until 3 parameters are accumulated, after which it _must_ find an option specification (even if it is a new occurrence of the same option).

#### Argument information

The information gathered by the parser is saved in an object that is passed as parameter to some of the [custom callbacks]. It contains details about the current argument sequence in the parsing loop, as listed below:

- `values` -- The previously parsed values. It it passed as an opaque object and should be cast to `OptionValues<typeof your_options>{:ts}`.
- `index` -- The starting index of the argument sequence. It will point to one of the following:
  - the occurrence of the option name
  - the first [option parameter], if the sequence comes from [positional] arguments
  - `NaN{:ts}`, if the data comes from the [environment]
- `name` -- The option name. Can be either of:
  - the name that was [supplied] on the command line
  - the option's [preferred name], if the sequence comes from [positional] arguments
  - an environment [data source], if the data comes from the [environment]
  - `'0'{:ts}`, if the data comes from the [standard input]
- `comp` -- True if performing [word completion]. Only available for the [parsing callback].
- `prev` -- The option parameters preceding the word being completed, if any. Only available for the [completion callback]. Will be empty for [single-valued] options.

### Word completion

Quoting the [Bash docs]:

> When word completion is attempted for an argument to a command for which a completion specification (a compspec) has been defined using the `complete` builtin (see Programmable Completion Builtins), the programmable completion facilities are invoked.

The parser does not use the completion facilities, because it relies on the raw command line and the cursor position into that line, which can be retrieved from the following environment variables:

- `COMP_LINE` or `BUFFER` -- the current command line
- `COMP_POINT` or `CURSOR` -- the index of the cursor position relative to the beginning of the command line

When these variables are available, the parser enters into _completion_ mode: it truncates the command line at the cursor position and performs completion of the last argument.

The result of completion is a [text message], which should be printed in the terminal so that the completion builtins can perform the final completion step.

> [!NOTE]
>
> The parser ignores any errors thrown by callbacks during completion. If an error is thrown by a completion callback, the default completion message (an empty list) will be thrown instead.

#### Completion algorithm

The completion algorithm implemented by the library is explained below. In what follows, _comp_ is the word being completed, i.e., the command-line argument ending at the [completion index] (it may be an empty string):

1. If _comp_ is expected to be an option name:
   - If _comp_ is a known option name, that name is returned; else
   - If there is no [positional] option, the available [option names] are filtered by the prefix _comp_ and returned; else
   - _comp_ is treated as a parameter of the positional option; go to step 2
2. Else, _comp_ is the parameter of a [non-niladic] option. Then, either of the following is executed and its result is combined with that of step 3:
   - If the option has a [completion callback], it is called with _comp_; else
   - If it has [parameter choices], they are filtered by the prefix _comp_; else
   - An empty list is returned
3. If the option was [supplied] neither through a [positional marker] nor as an [inline parameter], then, if either of the following holds true, the available [option names] are filtered by the prefix _comp_ and returned:
   - It is the first argument in a sequence of positional arguments; or
   - It is not short of the minimum expected parameter count of an option

If all of the above results in an empty list, the default completion (usually file completion, if enabled) will be attempted by the completion builtins.

#### Altered parsing behavior

Since completion builtins always expect a word list as a result, the parser must suppress all errors that occur in the parsing procedure until completion is done. Furthermore, it does not make sense to perform some operations that may throw errors. Therefore, when completion is in effect, the parsing behavior changes in the following ways:

- parsing errors, such as unknown [option names], are suppressed
- non-valued options ([help] and [version]) are skipped
- the parsing callback of [subcommands] do not get executed
- option [requirements] are not verified
- [cluster] arguments are immediately completed with the default completion message

> [!TIP]
>
> Other arguments are processed as usual, which means that a [completion callback] can inspect the previously parsed values, in order to make better suggestions based on those values.

#### Completion suggestions

Depending on the value of the `COMP_JSON` environment variable, the parser may emit an enhanced version of completion words, called _suggestions_. They are produced as an instance of the [JSON message]. From the parser perspective, a suggestion is a `ParserSuggestion` object with the following properties:

- `name` -- the suggestion name (or the value used for traditional shell completion)
- `type` -- the type of argument being suggested (either the [option type] or `'parameter'{:ts}`)
- `synopsis` -- the [option synopsis], if any
- `displayName` -- the [supplied] option name, in case the suggestion pertains to an [option parameter]

From the client code perspective, suggestions are the result of a [completion callback]. Each of which can be a plain `string{:ts}` or an object extending `ICompletionSuggestion`. It will be injected with the above properties by the parser and overridden by client properties. We recommend extending the `Suggestion` type from [autocomplete-types].

### Requirements checking

When the parser evaluates option [requirements], it compares an [option value] against any value required by other options. Generally, this analysis is performed after _all_ arguments have been parsed, but it may be performed in two additional situations:

- before calling the [parsing callback] of an option that has [break loop] set
- before parsing [subcommands]

> [!NOTE]
>
> As has been mentioned previously, requirements are _not_ checked when [word completion] is in effect.

### Name suggestions

When the parser expects an option name and the current argument is not a valid one (and there is no [positional] option), it may select [option names] that are similar to the current argument using the [Gestalt] algorithm, and include them in the error message.

### Inline parameters

An [option parameter] may be passed on the command line using the syntax `<name>=<param>`. The parameter can also be delimited by a [separator], in the case of [array] options.

> [!NOTE]
>
> This syntax cannot be used with the [positional marker].

As is the case with standalone parameters, inlined ones do not conflict with [option names], and so they may contain any number of equals signs. They may even start with one (e.g., `-opt=='my val'` would be parsed as `'=my val'{:ts}`).

Cluster arguments may also have inline parameters, but their syntax is different. A [cluster] argument is considered to have an inline parameter if it contains an unknown letter that is _not the first_ one in the cluster. In this case, the first letter _must_ correspond to an option and the rest to its parameter. See [cluster inline parameters] for further details.

### Process title

The process title will be updated to reflect the command being executed. This includes the main script and any [subcommands]. For example, if the command line is:

```sh
path/to/main/script.js -flag0 cmd1 -flag1 cmd2 args...
```

The process title would be updated in the following way:

1. `node` -- the starting title, before any updates
2. `node script.js` -- at the beginning of the parsing loop
3. `node script.js cmd1` -- as soon as the `cmd1` subcommand is parsed
4. `node script.js cmd1 cmd2` -- as soon as the `cmd2` subcommand is parsed

> [!NOTE]
>
> The title will remain in changed state after the parsing procedure returns.

Other [option names] are not used, not only because they would pollute the output of process management utilities (such as Linux's `ps`), but also because the process title reflects the current value of [program name], which appears in the [usage section] of help messages.
