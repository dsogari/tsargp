# Styles

The `Style` type is a string literal consisting of Select Graphic Rendition ([SGR]) sequences. It
can be used to customize the display of text in terminals that support it.

## Styling attributes

The `style` function accepts a list of styling attributes and creates a `Style` that can be used in
any part of the API that expects this type, or it can be embedded directly in text attributes, such
as the [option synopsis], [deprecation notice], [help section] texts, [error phrases] and [help
phrases].

Styles are cumulative, i.e., they can be combined with previous styles depending on the kind of
styling attribute. For instance, if the style of an option's description is `tf.bold{:ts}` and the
style of number values is `fg.yellow{:ts}`, then any number value (except those embedded in text
attributes) that appears in the option description will be rendered in bold intensity with yellow
foreground color.

In the next sections we present the various styling attributes available.

<Callout type="warning">
  Not all of the attributes are supported in every terminal, so you should experiment with them
  before committing your code.
</Callout>

### Type faces

The `tf` enumeration declares text type faces that can be combined together. They are listed below.

- Enabling attributes:
  - `bold` - bold or increased intensity

  - `crossedOut` - crossed-out or strikethrough
  - `doublyUnderlined` - doubly underlined
  - `proportionalSpacing` - proportional spacing
- Font-changing attributes:
  - `primaryFont` - primary font
  - `alternative[1-9]` - alternative font 1 through 9
  - `fraktur` - black-letter font

  - `notSuperscriptOrSubscript` - neither superscript nor subscript

### Predefined text colors

The `fg` and `bg` enumerations declare predefined foreground and background colors, respectively.
They both have the same colors, which are listed below.

- `default` - the default color
- Standard colors:
  - `black` - black
  - `red` - red
  - `green` - green
  - `yellow` - yellow
  - `blue` - blue
  - `magenta` - magenta
  - `cyan` - cyan
  - `white` - white
- High-intensity colors:
  - `brightBlack` - bright black (gray)
  - `brightRed` - bright red
  - `brightGreen` - bright green
  - `brightYellow` - bright yellow
  - `brightBlue` - bright blue
  - `brightMagenta` - bright magenta
  - `brightCyan` - bright cyan
  - `brightWhite` - bright white

### Extended text colors

In addition to predefined colors, there are three utility functions to get custom 8-bit colors:

- `fg8` - creates a foreground color from an 8-bit decimal value
- `bg8` - creates a background color from an 8-bit decimal value
- `ul8` - creates an underline color from an 8-bit decimal value

### Underline styles

The `ul` constant holds the styles of underlined text:

- `none` - no underline
- `single` - single underline
- `double` - double underline
- `curly` - curly underline
- `dotted` - dotted underline
- `dashed` - dashed underline

## ANSI strings

The `AnsiString` class is an internal component that handles the construction of strings that
can be printed on a terminal. It has methods to split, append and wrap strings, with or without
control sequences, and is used by the library in different places:

- by both the [parser] and [validator], to create error and warning messages
- by the [help formatter], to build help messages

The main logic implemented in this class is divided into _splitting_ and _wrapping_, as is explained
in the next sections.

### Text splitting

Text is split into paragraphs, list items and words using a combination of simple regular
expressions. The features supported in text splitting are described below.

#### Format specifiers

During splitting, format specifiers prefixed with a percent sign `%` may be extracted from the text
and processed by a formatting callback. This is used by the library in different places:

- by the both the [parser] and [validator], to produce error and warning messages based on
  configured [error phrases]
- by the [help formatter], to assemble help items from configured [help phrases]

This particular feature is only available in _phrases_, not in text attributes of option definitions.
Specifiers are meant to be replaced with a value (or values, in case of arrays). The available ones
are:

- `b` - a boolean value
- `s` - a string value
- `n` - a number value
- `r` - a regular expression
- `m` - a symbol value (e.g., option name)
- `t` - a ANSI string
- `u` - a URL hyperlink
- `a` - an array value
- `o` - an object value
- `v` - an unknown value (enclosed in angle brackets, like the [parameter column])

If a phrase supports values, the specifier can be used to indicate where in the phrase to place the
value. If a phrase has multiple alternatives (depending on the context), different texts may be
specified separated by a vertical bar and grouped in parentheses, e.g. `'(...|...)'{:ts}`.
Specifiers may also end with a single digit that represents a predefined value in an error message
or help item.

#### Inline styles

Text can contain inline styles. This applies as well to phrases as to text attributes, which the
formatter splits into words before adding to the help message.

When splitting text, the ANSI string will try its best to preserve styles. However, if you find
some corner case that is not currently covered by our unit tests, please submit a [bug report].

<Callout type="warning">
  Phrases can contain inline styles, but not in the _same_ word as a format specifier. Otherwise,
  they will mess up the text wrapping. For example, the following phrase is not valid:
  ``` `Requires ${style(tf.bold)}%p`{:ts} ```. You must insert a space in-between.
</Callout>

#### Paragraphs and lists

Although markdown syntax is not currently supported, paragraphs and itemized/numbered lists are
formatted similarly to how they would be in markdown. For example, the following text

```ansi
A paragraph with
  single line breaks,  redundant  spacing  and:
    - itemized; or
  1. numbered lists

  Another paragraph
```

Would be rendered as:

```ansi
A paragraph with single line breaks, redundant spacing and:
- itemized; or
1. numbered lists

Another paragraph
```

### Text wrapping

Text is wrapped according to a configured _width_, i.e., the number of terminal columns by which to
limit each line of text.

When a width of zero or `undefined{:ts}` is provided (which may happen if the output is being
redirected), the ANSI string will avoid wrapping and will suppress some control sequences that
would otherwise be used to render the text in a terminal.

The following features are supported in text wrapping.

#### Indentation level

A ANSI string optionally has an indentation level, i.e., the starting column of the text content,
relative to the first terminal column.

When wrapping text to the desired width, the ANSI string will attempt to respect this setting,
but if the desired width does not accommodate the length of the largest word while respecting the
string's indentation level, it will instead wrap lines relatively to the first terminal column.

#### Text alignment

A ANSI string has an optional flag that indicates whether the text should be aligned to the
terminal's right boundary when being wrapped. This feature is used by the formatter in the help
message's [description column].

## Messages

There are different kinds of content that an application might want to print in a terminal. We call
them "messages" and provide a specific class for each kind of message that the library can produce.

For convenience, all message classes have a `toString` method and a `message` property, both of
which can be used to obtain a traditional `string{:ts}` message. However, each class uses a default
terminal width to render the resulting string. The various classes are described below.

<Callout type="default">
  All messages produced by the library are instances of one of these classes. So you can check the
  kind of a captured message through `instanceof{:ts}`.
</Callout>

#### ANSI message

The `AnsiMessage` is a base class that wraps a list of ANSI strings.

The default terminal width used by this class is the value of the `'FORCE_WIDTH'{:ts}` environment
variable (if present), or the `columns` property of the standard _output_ stream (i.e.,
`process.stdout{:ts}`). Therefore, this kind of message should be printed with `console.log{:ts}` or
equivalent.

<Callout type="info">
  When redirecting the output of a command (e.g., writing to a file or piping to another command),
  the associated stream will not have a `columns` property, thus defaulting to zero.
</Callout>

This class provides an additional `wrap` method to get a traditional string. It accepts two optional
parameters:

- `width` - the desired terminal width (or zero to avoid wrapping)
- `emitStyles` - whether styles should be emitted

The default value of `emitStyles` depends on a few environment variables:

- `FORCE_COLOR` - force _emission_ of styles regardless of the terminal width
- `NO_COLOR` - force _omission_ of styles regardless of the terminal width
- `TERM` - set to `'dumb'{:ts}` to achieve the same behavior as `NO_COLOR`

Generally, you should not alter the returned string after being wrapped, as this will mess up the
disposition of text in the terminal. If you do need to, you can _prepend_ additional text ending
with a line feed character (`'\n'{:ts}`), or _append_ text starting with a line feed, as this will
preserve the disposition of wrapped text.

<Callout type="default">
  Alternatively, you can retrieve the underlying ANSI strings from the list and manipulate them
  before converting the message to string.
</Callout>

#### Warning message

The `WarnMessage` class is a specialization of the ANSI message, intended for warnings.

The default terminal width used by this class is the value of the `'FORCE_WIDTH'{:ts}` environment
variable (if present), or the `columns` property of the standard _error_ stream (i.e.,
`process.stderr{:ts}`). Therefore, this kind of message should be printed with `console.error{:ts}`
or equivalent.

#### Error message

The `ErrorMessage` class is a specialization of the standard `Error` class. It has the same
semantics as the warning message, so it should be printed with `console.error{:ts}` or equivalent.

#### Text message

The `TextMessage` class represents a list of text lines with no escape sequences or wrapping. It
produces a string with lines separated by line feeds, and should be printed with `console.log{:ts}`
or equivalent.

### Message configuration

Messages can be configured via a `MessageConfig` object that contains the properties described
below.

#### Message styles

The `styles` property specifies the styles of text elements in ANSI messages, and has the following
optional properties:

| Property  | Used for            | Default               |
| --------- | ------------------- | --------------------- |
| `boolean` | Boolean values      | `fg.blue{:ts}`        |
| `string`  | String values       | `fg.green{:ts}`       |
| `number`  | Number values       | `fg.yellow{:ts}`      |
| `regex`   | Regular expressions | `fg.red{:ts}`         |
| `option`  | Option names        | `fg.magenta{:ts}`     |
| `value`   | Unknown values      | `fg.brightBlack{:ts}` |
| `url`     | URLs                | `fg.cyan{:ts}`        |
| `text`    | General text        | `''{:ts}`             |

<Callout type="default">
  You can also set these styles to the empty string, if you want to disable text styling for your
  application.
</Callout>

#### Connective words

The `connectives` property specifies connective words that are used to format some text elements
that cannot be customized using phrases, such as option requirements, array element separators and
string quoting. It has the following optional properties, whose keys are enumerators from
`ConnectiveWord`:

| Property      | Description                                         | Default      |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| `and`         | Connects two logical expressions in conjunction     | `'and'{:ts}` |
| `or`          | Connects two logical expressions in disjunction     | `'or'{:ts}`  |
| `not`         | Connects a logical expression in negation           | `'not'{:ts}` |
| `no`          | Connects a logical expression in non-existence      | `'no'{:ts}`  |
| `equals`      | Connects two expressions in equality comparison     | `'=='{:ts}`  |
| `notEquals`   | Connects two expressions in non-equality comparison | `'!='{:ts}`  |
| `optionAlt`   | Connects two option names in alternation            | `'\|'{:ts}`  |
| `optionSep`   | Connects two option names in succession             | `','{:ts}`   |
| `stringQuote` | Encloses a string value                             | `"'"{:ts}`   |
| `arraySep`    | Connects two array elements in succession           | `','{:ts}`   |
| `arrayOpen`   | Opening bracket of an array value                   | `'['{:ts}`   |
| `arrayClose`  | Closing bracket of an array value                   | `']'{:ts}`   |
| `objectSep`   | Connects two object entries in succession           | `','{:ts}`   |
| `objectOpen`  | Opening bracket of an object value                  | `'{'{:ts}`   |
| `objectClose` | Closing bracket of an object value                  | `'}'{:ts}`   |
| `valueSep`    | Connects an object key with its value               | `':'{:ts}`   |

| `exprOpen`    | Opening bracket of an expression                    | `'('{:ts}`   |
| `exprClose`   | Closing bracket of an expression                    | `')'{:ts}`   |
